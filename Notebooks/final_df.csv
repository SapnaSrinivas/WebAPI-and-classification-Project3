4,Can someone explain my curent 'diet' plan? full story below,"Backstory: I have been trying to lose weight for some time now as i had gotten overweight 122kg's. I started in jan-february of this year to do something about it, so about 9 months in so far, tried a different thing every 3-4 weeks. Different diets, to working out to not working out.  
Working out didn't really do much for me, or it was the diet and workout that i did but i wasn't losing as much as i wanted , then i started to fast, that wasn't working at all, i was keeping my weight or gaining whenever i ate in the slightest. Then i tried many other diets and plans like intermitent fasting.   
All in all i got to 95kg in these 9 months, a good 27kg down. Had 2 months of stagnation, only lost 1kg, that was the fasting 'diets'. aka starving myself \^\^.  


Now the thing is i lost most of my weight in the last 3 weeks and again about 4 months ago  when i did it for 2-3 weeks as well. Both times it was when i had given up on the internet diets and just went back to my normal eating habbits, but i just cut them in half so i wouldn't get fat.  
NOw to me, this seems like i am eating a ton of unhealthy shit, but despite that i am losing pounds everyday and this is why i  don't understand it, i wanna write my 'meals' and see in what category it would FIT. If any.  
i lose 1 pound a day curently by doing this for 3 weeks now, me being in my thirties.

\-eat at 9:00 2 slices of bread, some dry salami or ham and really fat goat's cheese. make sum sandwiches basicly

\-12:00 or 13:00 My sweet tooth gets its fill, 2 chocolate croissants and maybe a banana or depends what other bakery stuff are there.

17:00 or 18:00 Heavy food, i switch it but often enough. A large portion of chips and chicken, always chicken. All the sauces possible. Mayo to garlic. AND SODA, always.  
And generally that is it, maybe i will even put in another slice of bread with jam at night if i feel hungry.

7,"My diet hacks: Intense flavors, a full stomach, and almost no calories.","The trick to forgetting you're dieting is to get lots of intense flavors on your tongue, get lots of bulk in your stomach, and to do it with virtually no calories. At Walmart, there are Great Value powdered drink mixes that come in over a dozen flavors for just $1.66 for a container of six pouches, and each pouch mixes with 2 quarts (1.9 liters) of water. Essentially, you're getting massive 2-liter liquid Jolly Rancher candies, but 2 liters is just 28¢ and 40 calories. You can safely get through 4 liters of liquid a day (but only 1 liter an hour), and 1 liter fills you up enough to help you delay your next meal. Don't just sip a glass, drink enough to fill you up. It won't fill you for as long as eating a meal, but the point is to just help you delay a meal or skip a snack.

Another trick is to suck on a sugar-free hard candy (Life Savers, Jolly Rancher and Werthers make them). Holding something intensely flavorful in your mouth curbs the urge to eat because you feel like you're already eating.

I highly recommend getting multiple flavors of the drink mixes, because you'll quickly get tired of just one. You can obviously use diet sodas or flavored seltzers instead, but the variety and intensity of the fruit flavors makes it seem more like pigging out on candy to me. Crystal Light and sugar-free Kool-Aid are other powdered drink options. Personally, I found the berry pomegranate and cherry pomegranate mixes to be more complex flavors, while the grape and cherry may either remind you of children's medicine or Jolly Ranchers. The tea flavors didn't appeal to me, but other people must like them.

My easy preparation method for the drink mixes is to just wash out a 2 liter bottle, fill it up halfway with water, pour the mix in, put the cap on and shake it until nothing settles to the bottom or is stuck to the sides, then fill it the rest of the way and either drink it immediately or refrigerate it. Warning: always open the pouches inside the sink (not the counter near the sink, but INSIDE THE SINK) and pour them into the bottles while still inside the sink. If you don't, invisible powder will drift in the air, only to be seen when the counter gets wet and then you have stains you have to scrub out. Also, test new flavors to see if they color your tongue or lips. Most flavors don't, but some (like cherry) are more likely to.

# Natural Alternative

If you don't like artificial foods, here's the natural alternative: Just drink a large amount of water or other low-calorie or zero-calorie drink with your meals. The water will ""bulk up"" your food in your stomach and make your body think you've eaten a satisfyingly huge amount of food. Also, your body senses liquid faster than solid foods, so it will sense the bulk from the water while you're still eating, even if you're eating fast, helping you stop eating sooner. It's probably a good idea to try to shift progressively away from the artificial drinks to this method, and even to just plain water on its own over time as you wean yourself off the junk food cravings.

If you're not into the intensely artificial drinks OR plain water, dollar stores have La Croix in 2-liter bottles, which is just sparkling water with some natural flavor. Don't think of it as an alternative to soda, because you'll be disappointed at the subtlety of the flavor. Think of it instead as a more flavorful alternative to plain water. I mention the 2-liter bottles because remember it isn't just for refreshment, it's to fill you up, albeit temporarily.

11,Potassium.. none of us are getting enough. So how do we do it?,"I've always struggled with getting enough potassium on a daily basis. It's recommended that adults get at least 4.7g (4,700mg) per day, which is a LOT! I mean, we're talking like 15 bananas per day a lot. Or like 10 cups of cooked spinach a lot. You get the point.

Studies suggest that less than 2% of all adults in the US get the recommended 4.7g each day. That's an insane stat to me. Yet potassium is so crucial to heart health, among other things in our bodies. It keeps our blood pressure in check and the blood circulating, and helps ward off heart disease and the calcification of arteries (with help from calcium).

Yet, when I look at my diet, I barely get 1g per day. I simply cannot fathom how one can honestly consume 4.7g every.. single.. day.

It's also stated that consuming &lt;= 1g per day puts you at risk of developing heart disease at a much earlier age as opposed to if you consume the daily recommended amount.

16,What am I doing wrong?,"I know that’s a very broad question but I am feeling stuck lately. I have been actively trying to lose weight for about a year now and nothing I’ve tried seems to work. 

I have tried counting my calories and I feel completely hungry at the end of the day. For reference I am 5’7” and eat around 2000 calories. I lift 5 to 6 days a week &amp; walk 20 minutes every morning, 30 minutes over lunch &amp; sometimes I walk at night if I haven’t hit my step goal.

23,Why am I tired. (1000 calories a day to 3000 calories a day),"
little background + tldr at the bottom:

I’ve always had a bad appetite averaging 1000 calories a day which lead to me looking like the stickman I am today and used weigh 49kg at 5’9 and 18yo. I always felt tired and dizzy and just got used to it really. Wanting to get big, I upped my calorie intake from food to 2000 a day and bought myself a gainer shake to chug at the end of the day to get myself to 3000. Gained 6kg in 2 weeks (but that includes water weight from creatine loading that I also started this week). On the 3rd week I swapped the gainer shakes for more food because my appetite grew, also my food is quite healthy now I think (eggs, chicken, tuna, cheese, pancakes, honey). 

I thought at this point I should be feeling healthier and fitter than ever but now I find myself sleeping every chance I get often reaching 12 hours a day. Is this something to do with my workouts or is my body just in shock from the fact that it’s not starving for the first time in over 10 years?

24,Improve my diet vs spending more time at the gym?,"33 year old male. I've been going to the gym now for 6 months. I've been making progress every 1-2 weeks in regards to strength training. No issues there. Where I am having trouble is on the scale. When I first started working out I was approx 230 lbs (on a 5'10"" frame if that matters at all) with the goal to lose weight while adding additional muscle. Everything was going great. I've been strict about my gym routine. I've kept a relatively clean diet (which was put together by a nutritionist, not something I made up). I dropped about 25 lbs.

Recently my weight loss has started to plateau, even starting to creep back up. I haven't changed anything. I still go to the gym 6 days a week. I still eat fairly clean. In an attempt to curb the weight gain I tried cutting calories and became even more strict in what I ate but that immediately backfired. I started to feel tired more easily, even had a harder time getting through my routines. So I went back to what I was doing before.

BUT I realize that if I want to continue losing weight I need to try something. I can try and experiment with my diet again, but I am very resistant to that idea. So I'm wondering how much effort is required to try and change my weight at the gym level. I've been thinking of changing my routine a little by adding one more exercise each day, adding some ab/core exercises on alternating days, and possibly going in on my rest day to jog on the treadmill. I feel like I don't need to do a lot to tip the scales back into a more favorable direction...

28,Can I lose weight despite being a picky eater?,"All my life I've had trouble eating normal, healthy foods, fairly to my health's expense. I'm a 17yo male standing at 5'10 &amp; ~245lb, and really want to cut that last number down. I'm willing to put in the work, but I'm not sure if I can following what my tongue will let me. Over the years with my parents making me try several things, we've found I'm horrible with all vegetables, to the point that plenty make me nearly gag at the scent. I can't tolerate the bitter tastes (and for things such as potatoes, the textures make me gag). Even non-bitters like Sweet Potatoes aren't liked, and beans are the same. A lot of meats are fairly iffy, though fish are good. Other than that, I tend to be okay, with grains, dairy, and all fruits being good by me.

With those limitations, can a healthy diet be constructed? Or is there something I can do to somehow get around them?

Edit: Things I eat include:

&gt;Breakfast foods, such as eggs, bacon, pancakes, etc. aside from sausage

&gt;A lot of junk food, which is the overwhelming majority that's definitely in need of being cut out. Chips, pizza, Mac &amp; Cheese, chicken nuggets, stuff like that.

35,"If you live alone, have no social life, and can control what you eat while at work or school, this plan might work for you as well as it does for me. Relatively painless weight loss and weight maintenance while eating all your favorite foods.","Well, maybe not all your favorite foods, but I can keep salted nuts and other forbidden foods without it ruining my intake. I have a pantry with a door that can be locked. I made a mechanism that allows me to use the key for the first part of the day. During that part, I eat sensibly and frequently. After about noon or so, I put the key away and can't get to it until the next morning. Before locking the pantry, I dole out what I am allowed to eat for the remainder of the day.

That old issue of thinking ""I'll go have a small helping of mixed nuts"", which turned into way too many, no longer exists. At each step of my weight loss, I fine tuned the amounts so that I was losing slowly without any real discomfort. Once I got to my target, it's an ongoing process of adding a bit here or subtracting a bit there so that when I weigh each day and plot in on a chart, there is no upward trend.

It's pretty odd and won't suit most people who have families or go out to eat pizza, but if you're desperate it might be the thing for you. In addition to the lockable pantry, I used to keep plastic tool boxes in the fridge and freezer so that I could keep ice cream and other foods, but I eventually stopped buying those, and eat cheese types that I can control with good old-fashioned will power. If I had access to bread or crackers, the cheese would have to be locked up, but crackers and bread stay safely in the pantry.

And finally, this is a wonderful way to handle drinking problems.

37,A diet not centered around weight loss or bulking up?,"I'm a 27 year old male. My weight it about average, maybe slightly under by a few pounds, but I'm at a healthy weight. Weight isn't something I'm looking at for my diet. Yet, when I try to research diets all I find is losing weight or bulking up. 

I'm just trying to eat healthier. I don't eat great, and it may not be a problem right now (my job is active) but I'll probably pay for it in the future. So if I start a habit of eating better now, I should be good down the line. I feel I'd do better with some kind of guide though. I always tell myself I'll eat better, but then I mess up, because I don't know what's right. I wonder what better is exactly. Sure I can cut out candy and soda but I know there is more to it. 

I do have some digestive issues, and I know it's diet related. I'll eat a couple junk meals and my stomach will punish me for it. Nothing major, just a lot of discomfort and irregularity. 

All I can find online is Keto and Paleo, which I believe are both about weight loss? A few random ""lose weight fast!"" scams, and the ""Want more muscle? Guzzle gallons of protein powder!"" I'm just looking for a diet plan I can follow that will let me be healthier and feel better. That's all.

39,Dietary Supplements,"Hi guys, I’m new here but I’ve been logging food for a few weeks now. My mom gave me these diet supplement pills, and swears by them, but I’m not trusting of that. I researched them a bit and found virtually no scientific claims of them helping more than a placebo. Should I take them? Would they be harmful and if you do recommend them, can you provide some actual evidence of them working?

P.s. this a product from a pyramid scheme, thus the hesitation.

42,Podcast Episode 63 The Alkaline Diet,"In this week’s podcast, we discuss the alkaline diet.

According to this diet, it is in our best interest to make sure we eat more alkaline foods than acid foods, so that we end up an a more overall alkaline state.

This will supposedly protect us from the diseases of modern civilization; things like cancer, obesity and diabetes. To test this, you measure the pH of your urine using pH strips. pH is the measure of a sample’s acidity or alkalinity. 

In order to get in a more alkaline state, this diet promotes the consumption of fruits and vegetables. However, what proponents of this diet don’t tell you, is that the food we eat has no effect on our blood pH. 

The food we eat can and does change the pH of our urine, however, urine pH has no effect on blood pH nor has it been shown to have any impact on our overall health. So it’s a pointless measurement that provides no meaningful data. 

To learn more about the alkaline diet and all its half truths and pitfalls, check out this week’s podcast!

43,Why are so many sources on the internet so paranoid about food?,"Hello there. I haven't really looked into this subreddit ever before, but I admittedly felt like venting a little bit (although I'll try to constructively ask some questions.)

A little info about myself: I am in my late twenties and have been diagnosed with a heightened level of LDL cholesterol in my blood. I noticed that because of some superficial deposit of fat on my skin and my dermatologist identified it as such. He remarked that while this is normal it is highly unusual for somebody of my age to get this kinda problem already.

To cut a long story short, this may be something I inherited from my family's end and I have to watch my diet now to avoid health risks in the future.

Trying to look up different diets and the such (for workout purposes) always had deterred me before and now that I spent a lot of energy and time in doing that again I realized why: So many bloggers, sources and everything really is so paranoid about food.

When reading up on soy the only thing you find is the estrogen debate (many people still believe it's the actual hormone for some reason) or whether or not it causes cancer. Looking up whether or not eggs are bad lead you to people just trying to defend the status quo and citing single sources that support their claims without any kind of experience reports. Qutting animal fats is also bad according to the same people because you get an increased risk of disease. You can't quit dairy because apparently that makes your immune system tank. But quitting dairy can make you feel better according to other such bloggers without any sources.

It really feels like most of the people talking about food don't really have a problem with these foods themselves and try to defend their favourite products to death.

Sorry that I am being a bit vague but I want to avoid brigading, so you'll have to take my word for it if you didn't observe this kind of stuff yourself.

My question to you is: Can you recommend good sources that talk about the ""science"" involved with foods? Ideally I'd like to find some source that is exhaustive about what makes every food (for example animal fats/saturated fats vs. unsaturated fats with both cons and pros for both) and offers an overview of what is in the market and perhaps with suggestions of what kind of diets work for people who live healthy lives.

Of course, I am looking into getting to a nutritional specilalist, but I feel even until I get there, I wanted to read and evaluate a bit on my own what I should be doing and eating.

Thank you for your time and I wish everyone a great day!",0,many sources internet paranoid food,hello really looked subreddit ever admittedly felt like venting little bit although try constructively ask questions little info late twenties diagnosed heightened level ldl cholesterol blood noticed superficial deposit fat skin dermatologist identified remarked normal highly unusual somebody age get kinda problem already cut long story short may something inherited family end watch diet avoid health risks future trying look different diets workout purposes always deterred spent lot energy time realized many bloggers sources everything really paranoid food reading soy thing find estrogen debate many people still believe actual hormone reason whether causes cancer looking whether eggs bad lead people trying defend status quo citing single sources support claims without kind experience reports qutting animal fats also bad according people get increased risk disease quit dairy apparently makes immune system tank quitting dairy make feel better according bloggers without sources really feels like people talking food really problem foods try defend favourite products death sorry bit vague want avoid brigading take word observe kind stuff question recommend good sources talk science involved foods ideally like find source exhaustive makes every food example animal fats saturated fats vs unsaturated fats cons pros offers overview market perhaps suggestions kind diets work people live healthy lives course looking getting nutritional specilalist feel even get wanted read evaluate bit eating thank time wish everyone great day,many source internet paranoid food ,hello really looked subreddit ever admittedly felt like venting little bit although try constructively ask question little info late twenty diagnosed heightened level ldl cholesterol blood noticed superficial deposit fat skin dermatologist identified remarked normal highly unusual somebody age get kinda problem already cut long story short may something inherited family end watch diet avoid health risk future trying look different diet workout purpose always deterred spent lot energy time realized many blogger source everything really paranoid food reading soy thing find estrogen debate many people still believe actual hormone reason whether cause cancer looking whether egg bad lead people trying defend status quo citing single source support claim without kind experience report qutting animal fat also bad according people get increased risk disease quit dairy apparently make immune system tank quitting dairy make feel better according blogger without source really feel like people talking food really problem food try defend favourite product death sorry bit vague want avoid brigading take word observe kind stuff question recommend good source talk science involved food ideally like find source exhaustive make every food example animal fat saturated fat v unsaturated fat con pro offer overview market perhaps suggestion kind diet work people live healthy life course looking getting nutritional specilalist feel even get wanted read evaluate bit eating thank time wish everyone great day ,mani sourc internet paranoid food ,hello realli look subreddit ever admittedli felt like vent littl bit although tri construct ask question littl info late twenti diagnos heighten level ldl cholesterol blood notic superfici deposit fat skin dermatologist identifi remark normal highli unusu somebodi age get kinda problem alreadi cut long stori short may someth inherit famili end watch diet avoid health risk futur tri look differ diet workout purpos alway deter spent lot energi time realiz mani blogger sourc everyth realli paranoid food read soy thing find estrogen debat mani peopl still believ actual hormon reason whether caus cancer look whether egg bad lead peopl tri defend statu quo cite singl sourc support claim without kind experi report qut anim fat also bad accord peopl get increas risk diseas quit dairi appar make immun system tank quit dairi make feel better accord blogger without sourc realli feel like peopl talk food realli problem food tri defend favourit product death sorri bit vagu want avoid brigad take word observ kind stuff question recommend good sourc talk scienc involv food ideal like find sourc exhaust make everi food exampl anim fat satur fat vs unsatur fat con pro offer overview market perhap suggest kind diet work peopl live healthi live cours look get nutrit specilalist feel even get want read evalu bit eat thank time wish everyon great day

**Dislikes food wise**: Minty things?

**The Story:** Through high school I was thin and muscular.  I worked out 5 days a week at a gym lifting weights.  I began to date later in High School and by the time I was in college I wasn't working out but eating like I was.  I now weight 375 at 5 ft 11 inches as of this morning.  I have tried low carb (Adkins) and low calorie(2000) but I don't seem to be able to maintain. By some miracle I have normal blood pressure, glucose levels, and cholesterol.  I have most recently tried phentermine and it hasn't worked.  I wasn't Hungary for around a week and lost 8 lbs but forced my self to eat 2000 calories and I lost.  After the first week I began to get Hungary all the time and I swear I and Hungary more now than before.  I have three kids and I want to be around when there grown up.

**Looking for input:**

I want to be realistic.  I have kids and have to be able to have food in the house for them to eat.  They eat things I shouldn't have.  I would need something to eat in the afternoon to keep me from snaking.  I know me and will want something.  I haven't been realistic and the past and try starving my self or doing low carb hard core and it doesn't work long term.  I want to change my life around.  I work in IT and I am pretty sedentary and broke my tail bone and suffer bad back pain from it when I am very active.  I also have the allergies and can't eat a bunch of stuff.

Can someone suggest a realistic diet?  I would like to start walking when I loose some weight.  Right now I can't walk more than 500 ft without being in bad back pain.  I know weight loss will help the back.  Please don't be like eat a hand full of this and 2 oz of this.  I need to be realistic as to what I can do.  I have a budget and feed 3 other people(I am divorced and kids part time).",0,suggestions appreciated weight loss,likes pizza hamburgers french fries hot dogs tacos lasagna spaghetti also like doritos barbecue chips soft chocolate chip cookies also drink little water mostly diet dr pepper eat drink often allergies rye wheat barley nuts sea food fish shell fish know sea food peas chicken skin turkey eat throat swells use eppi pen dislikes food wise minty things story high school thin muscular worked 5 days week gym lifting weights began date later high school time college working eating like weight 375 5 ft 11 inches morning tried low carb adkins low calorie 2000 seem able maintain miracle normal blood pressure glucose levels cholesterol recently tried phentermine worked hungary around week lost 8 lbs forced self eat 2000 calories lost first week began get hungary time swear hungary three kids want around grown looking input want realistic kids able food house eat eat things would need something eat afternoon keep snaking know want something realistic past try starving self low carb hard core work long term want change life around work pretty sedentary broke tail bone suffer bad back pain active also allergies eat bunch stuff someone suggest realistic diet would like start walking loose weight right walk 500 ft without bad back pain know weight loss help back please like eat hand full 2 oz need realistic budget feed 3 people divorced kids part time,suggestion appreciated weight loss ,like pizza hamburger french fry hot dog taco lasagna spaghetti also like doritos barbecue chip soft chocolate chip cooky also drink little water mostly diet dr pepper eat drink often allergy rye wheat barley nut sea food fish shell fish know sea food pea chicken skin turkey eat throat swell use eppi pen dislike food wise minty thing story high school thin muscular worked 5 day week gym lifting weight began date later high school time college working eating like weight 375 5 ft 11 inch morning tried low carb adkins low calorie 2000 seem able maintain miracle normal blood pressure glucose level cholesterol recently tried phentermine worked hungary around week lost 8 lb forced self eat 2000 calorie lost first week began get hungary time swear hungary three kid want around grown looking input want realistic kid able food house eat eat thing would need something eat afternoon keep snaking know want something realistic past try starving self low carb hard core work long term want change life around work pretty sedentary broke tail bone suffer bad back pain active also allergy eat bunch stuff someone suggest realistic diet would like start walking loose weight right walk 500 ft without bad back pain know weight loss help back please like eat hand full 2 oz need realistic budget feed 3 people divorced kid part time ,suggest appreci weight loss ,like pizza hamburg french fri hot dog taco lasagna spaghetti also like dorito barbecu chip soft chocol chip cooki also drink littl water mostli diet dr pepper eat drink often allergi rye wheat barley nut sea food fish shell fish know sea food pea chicken skin turkey eat throat swell use eppi pen dislik food wise minti thing stori high school thin muscular work 5 day week gym lift weight began date later high school time colleg work eat like weight 375 5 ft 11 inch morn tri low carb adkin low calori 2000 seem abl maintain miracl normal blood pressur glucos level cholesterol recent tri phentermin work hungari around week lost 8 lb forc self eat 2000 calori lost first week began get hungari time swear hungari three kid want around grown look input want realist kid abl food hous eat eat thing would need someth eat afternoon keep snake know want someth realist past tri starv self low carb hard core work long term want chang life around work pretti sedentari broke tail bone suffer bad back pain activ also allergi eat bunch stuff someon suggest realist diet would like start walk loos weight right walk 500 ft without bad back pain know weight loss help back pleas like eat hand full 2 oz need realist budget feed 3 peopl divorc kid part time

But I'm just looking for easy alternatives to eggs really. Plus im a bad cook. But yeah. If anyone knows a bit about yogurt/ daily intake and wouldnt mind looking below..

52,Calories in Alcohol vs food,"I recently stopped drinking after having a significant habit of around 7 beers a day and as many as 12 toward the end when I realized I needed to stop. My question is that if there are indeed as many calories in alcohol how come they don’t show up on the scale like the same amount of food calories would?

I am hoping that by eliminating all alcohol from my diet and eating what I did to sustain my weight while consuming alcohol (maybe slightly less) that I will be able to lose weight gradually. 

Should this end up happening? The reason why I don’t understand or am skeptical is that if I drink 6 300 calorie beers it won’t show up on the scale for me but if I eat 1800 calories that most certainly shows up on the scale.",0,calories alcohol vs food,recently stopped drinking significant habit around 7 beers day many 12 toward end realized needed stop question indeed many calories alcohol come show scale like amount food calories would hoping eliminating alcohol diet eating sustain weight consuming alcohol maybe slightly less able lose weight gradually end happening reason understand skeptical drink 6 300 calorie beers show scale eat 1800 calories certainly shows scale,calorie alcohol v food ,recently stopped drinking significant habit around 7 beer day many 12 toward end realized needed stop question indeed many calorie alcohol come show scale like amount food calorie would hoping eliminating alcohol diet eating sustain weight consuming alcohol maybe slightly le able lose weight gradually end happening reason understand skeptical drink 6 300 calorie beer show scale eat 1800 calorie certainly show scale ,calori alcohol vs food ,recent stop drink signific habit around 7 beer day mani 12 toward end realiz need stop question inde mani calori alcohol come show scale like amount food calori would hope elimin alcohol diet eat sustain weight consum alcohol mayb slightli less abl lose weight gradual end happen reason understand skeptic drink 6 300 calori beer show scale eat 1800 calori certainli show scale 
53,Weight Loss Plateau (Near 10% bodyfat),"Hey Reddit,

Wondering if I can get help and input on something. Been dieting a while and seeing great results. Almost there at 10% bodyfat and Abs coming in.

Slight issue though... past few weeks , even 2 months I'd say, weight hasnt been really budging.

Currently im cutting on 1800 calories a day (I'm weighing and tracking all the food). On top of that I do 500 cals worth of cardio on post-workout daily.

Weight has been hovering at 72kg for ages now (I started at 80kg).

So much so I even took a diet-break for a week to reset the hormones and hopefully drop water weight. During that time I ate at around 2400-2600 calories. Post-diet break week.. weight is at 72.7kg or so. Crazy thing is i thought the water weight I gained from carbs and such as well as glycogen stores would flush out after few days and I'd be back to 72kg and and dropping more. Seems as though even after maintenance week things are stubborn. Now I am stuck at around 72.7kg or so.

So my question is ... what am i to do in order to keep the progress going. Ideally I want to drop to 67-68kg.

I'm open to suggestions and instructions as to what I should do. Has anyone been through something like this before and how did U solve it?

So close to my goal , yet so far haha.

Extra info: My diet is mostly low carb, with my carbs coming in from fruits and vegetables. I dont take in anything processed such as pasta/rice/bread/etc",0,weight loss plateau near 10 bodyfat,hey reddit wondering get help input something dieting seeing great results almost 10 bodyfat abs coming slight issue though past weeks even 2 months say weight hasnt really budging currently im cutting 1800 calories day weighing tracking food top 500 cals worth cardio post workout daily weight hovering 72kg ages started 80kg much even took diet break week reset hormones hopefully drop water weight time ate around 2400 2600 calories post diet break week weight 72 7kg crazy thing thought water weight gained carbs well glycogen stores would flush days back 72kg dropping seems though even maintenance week things stubborn stuck around 72 7kg question order keep progress going ideally want drop 67 68kg open suggestions instructions anyone something like u solve close goal yet far haha extra info diet mostly low carb carbs coming fruits vegetables dont take anything processed pasta rice bread etc,weight loss plateau near 10 bodyfat ,hey reddit wondering get help input something dieting seeing great result almost 10 bodyfat ab coming slight issue though past week even 2 month say weight hasnt really budging currently im cutting 1800 calorie day weighing tracking food top 500 cals worth cardio post workout daily weight hovering 72kg age started 80kg much even took diet break week reset hormone hopefully drop water weight time ate around 2400 2600 calorie post diet break week weight 72 7kg crazy thing thought water weight gained carbs well glycogen store would flush day back 72kg dropping seems though even maintenance week thing stubborn stuck around 72 7kg question order keep progress going ideally want drop 67 68kg open suggestion instruction anyone something like u solve close goal yet far haha extra info diet mostly low carb carbs coming fruit vegetable dont take anything processed pasta rice bread etc ,weight loss plateau near 10 bodyfat ,hey reddit wonder get help input someth diet see great result almost 10 bodyfat ab come slight issu though past week even 2 month say weight hasnt realli budg current im cut 1800 calori day weigh track food top 500 cal worth cardio post workout daili weight hover 72kg age start 80kg much even took diet break week reset hormon hope drop water weight time ate around 2400 2600 calori post diet break week weight 72 7kg crazi thing thought water weight gain carb well glycogen store would flush day back 72kg drop seem though even mainten week thing stubborn stuck around 72 7kg question order keep progress go ideal want drop 67 68kg open suggest instruct anyon someth like u solv close goal yet far haha extra info diet mostli low carb carb come fruit veget dont take anyth process pasta rice bread etc

55,What is the Best Diet for a Hypoglycemic Person,"I have hypoglycemia that tends to flare up when I haven't eaten for a while, Or after I eat too much sugar. My weight has gotten out of control over the last couple years, and I'm having a difficult time sticking to any diets because they all seem to make me feel sluggish or they make me have a hypo episode. I think the biggest issue is I don't know how to eat or really what to eat with my hypoglycemia. Another issues I'm having is that if I try to workout, after about 20 to 30 minutes my blood sugar crashes after strenuous activity.

56,LCHF and WFPB lot in common and completely opposite and both work fantasically well but only one is sustainable,"Ive been studying and experimenting with diet since I was 5 years old.  That may seem odd and slightly improbable but it is 100 percent true...

Ive done the ketogenic diet for extended periods of time and achieved amazing results ... with few issues...

Ive also done the Whole Foods Plant Based diet (95% vegan very little animal food and dairy) , think Tom Brady ... its low in saturated fat and also low in ""sugars"" not carbs ... and achieved amazing results ... with few issues ...

Ive come to the conclusion that both diets are valid and have great health promoting benefits if done correctly and also depending on what ails you...nothing is one size fits all...

People with kidney disease should not go keto and people with seizures need to go keto ... et cetera ....

The real problem for me comes down to sustainability ...

There isnt enough land mass on earth to do animal agriculture in a sustainable way and meet the worlds gigantic populations' demand for beef, chicken, fish, eggs, and dairy.

The current model is literally destroying the planet ... the number one reason for rainforest deforestation and all the accompanying problems (reducing biodiversity, species extinction, etcetera) is animal agriculture.

The number one reason behind a 95,000 square mile oceanic dead zone where life cannot exist is animal agriculture...


The reason is simple.  To feed 9 billion people beef and pork requires a rather dehumanizing and cruel not too mention dirty and disease ridden mass slaughter of billions upon billions of animals each year ... all of these animals produce a ton of shit and the shit isnt being treated and therefore is destroying the environment ...


This is why the conclusion is that only the whole foods plant based diet is sustainable.  The keto diet where animal products are the main thing you eat isnt a sustainable diet for the whole planet, while it may be necessary for certain individuals.


Also, Ive noticed that Im healthier on the PBWF diet than the LCHF diet...my eyesight is better, no light sensitivity, my skin is clearer, my digestion and elimination is way better (clean wipe every time)...


Mostly similar results were achieved with either method, but I never got or get the keto flu or anything like that.  No halitosis.  The weight loss is faster with keto but its harder to stick to and ultimately for me anyway led to a rubber band effect because Id be craving foods.

With a PBWF diet I feel full and satisfied all the time with zero food cravings.  Also, just anecdotally ... when I look at the people from the movie ""The magic pill"" versus the people from ""Forks Over Knives"" ... the people on the plant based diet have a far healthier, more centered look to them.  They just look better...

One big difference for me is inflammation.  I do barbell training, bodyweight training, running, martial arts, and Im a contractor, up n down ladders all day and when I was on keto...

After lifting or working hard one day , the next day Id be sore with imflammation, and after eliminating almost all the animal food from my diet - after I lift the normal pains in my back and rotator cuff that I thought was coming with age ... its all gone ...

I can squat heavy one day and between then and my next workoit I am no longer experiencing the crippling DOMS or muscle soreness and instead my body just feels good all the time...


Overall there is a lot of commonality between the 2 approaches.  Both say no sugars and no processed foods.  Both say whole foods and lots of plants.

The difference is the animals.  As a person concerned about the environment it is clear that if we dont significantly reduce the worlds demand for animal foods the problem is going to escalate dramatically.


Also, as a person with at least some compassion...I can only source the little animal food I do consume from humane sources...


The lions share of the animal agricutlure industry is brutally cruel and inhumane.  The overcrowding leads to diseases which leads to antibiotics which leads to new dieseases resistent to the antibiotics and there is evidence we could entire an era where antibiotics dont work...plus youve got outbreaks of H1N1 or swine flu, bird flu, and mad cow cases that all originate from animal agricultre ...


The only diet that is sustainable and provides the best overall health for the worlds population is the WFPB diet and thats why aside from people using the keto plan to lose some quick weight or to address seizures, the WFPB diet is the one that wins out in the end.

57,I can't change my muscle/fat ratio,"Please take a look on my daily food source &amp; training schedules. I ran out of ideas how i could change my muscle/fat ratio. My general goal is to be 82 kgs with 10-12% body fat.

&amp;#x200B;

Personal info - Male / 27 yrs / 176 cm / 76 kg / 15% body fat

&amp;#x200B;

Food source (generally)

Breakfast options: eggs/oats/tuna/cottage cheese/ham/bacon/peanut butter/puffed rice

Lunch options: meat/rice/salad/vegetables/fish

Dinner options: eggs/salad/vegetables/cottage cheese/cheese/peanut butter/tuna

Mid snacks: protein shake/protein bar/peanuts/fruits/dark chocolate/oat biscuits

&amp;#x200B;

Training

Office job (sitting most of the day)

1-1,5 hrs 4-6 power training/week

0,5-1 hrs cardio 1-2 times/week

&amp;#x200B;

My measures over the past 7 years depending on my actual diet/cardio/additional supplements are

71 kgs 6,5% bf/55% muscle - 30 kms cycling daily/reduced calories

75 kgs 14% bf/ 58% muscle - keto diet/lifting

78 kgs 16% bf/60% muscle - HIIT/high calories

82 kgs 18% bf/62% muscle - bulking/lifting

&amp;#x200B;

I have no problem losing or gaining weight but i can't change my fat/muscle ratio for the good.

No matter if i eat trendemous amounts of supplements/reduce carbs/fat &amp; increase cardio/power trainings

I can't go over my natural limit to build muscle mass &amp; reduce fat. They values always move together.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what should i change to effectively separate these two moving values.

59,Why has my weight loss ceased?,"I  have had a really hard time getting over a hump. I have been religiously cutting calories and meal prepping for the past 12 weeks. I  am wondering if I have a further issue, medically speaking, or if my cheat meals are really screwing me this badly.

Currently  I am 238, started at 249 about 12 weeks ago. I am on track to lose  between 1.5 and 2 pounds a week. I have 1 cheat meal a week where I  don't tabulate the calories for it and go pretty crazy, couldn't be more than 1200 calories though. I went down to 236 2 weeks ago, then  strangely back up to 238, I don't know how that is possible. I weigh  myself 1 time a week on Monday. I got on the scale today and weigh 238. I  feel good and think I look better, yet some how my weight has gone back  up. Should I get my thyroid tested? What else could be the problem or  am I jut being impatient and this hump is normal? I think I have been  bouncing around this weight for like a month. Going up and down by two  pounds and it's so fucking weird because when I was younger, this never  happened. Now that I am 30, it's been really hard to get over this hump.

Sometimes,  before bed, I will eat 2 cucumbers with olive oil and red win vinegar  on them to help me feel full. I think it is kind of irrelevant since  cucumbers are so low in calories, and so is vinegar, the olive oil  (which I am not even getting it all) is maybe 2 tablespoons.

65,my sugar addiction is killing me,"most of us know that fat isn't the problem, it's sugar. well, sugar is in everything. EVERYTHING. yes, i have a sweet tooth, but that's just one problem. i need some people to be honest with me on something because, for the last year, i have had one 23 oz. can of arizona green tea almost every day for the last year and a half.

one of these cans is 17g of sugar per serving, making each serving 70 calories. the number of servings per can is approximately 3. i drink one can over the course of one day.

if i were to be more careful with my diet, cut back on sugar in everything else, as well as exercise (to the best of my ability due to numerous complications), will i be able to lose weight if the tea is my one vice? is it going to keep me craving more sugar and make it harder to resist other things i'm weak to? will it take longer to lose weight even if i keep everything else out? i know that sugar helps keep on the fat, which is a problem. seriously, do i need to give this up? i don't drink soda or juice, well, a soda every so often, but not regularly. the other thing i drink is water, but not nearly as much.

be honest. be CIVIL, but be honest. i don't have a dietition, though i wish i did, i feel like i need professional help. thing is, my depression makes me lazier than lazy, and so i'm so heavy, walking hurts my shins. of course, i want to see a doctor to make sure it's not a different problem, and walking will make it worse. i'd rather find out from a doctor that it IS my weight and not something i can detect on my own. but that makes it hard to exercise because it eliminates walking, and i really want to walk around. i live in boise, and there's so much to do and see, but it's agony every time i try, even just walking to a grocery store. not to mention i have social anxiety disorder, so i can't leave the house alone.

basically... i am so unhappy with myself in every way. the weight is one of my biggest problems. must i give up the tea, and what other things can i do to fight sugar addiction. i've been trying to eat more fruit, but i also LOVE baking, so that sucks that i, you know, have to stop that... i am so unhappy. i know this was kind of a rant, but i wanted to express the seriousness of my self esteem issues. there are a lot more factors that play into all of this, but i think that'd be TMI.",0,sugar addiction killing,us know fat problem sugar well sugar everything everything yes sweet tooth one problem need people honest something last year one 23 oz arizona green tea almost every day last year half one cans 17g sugar per serving making serving 70 calories number servings per approximately 3 drink one course one day careful diet cut back sugar everything else well exercise best ability due numerous complications able lose weight tea one vice going keep craving sugar make harder resist things weak take longer lose weight even keep everything else know sugar helps keep fat problem seriously need give drink soda juice well soda every often regularly thing drink water nearly much honest civil honest dietition though wish feel like need professional help thing depression makes lazier lazy heavy walking hurts shins course want see doctor make sure different problem walking make worse rather find doctor weight something detect makes hard exercise eliminates walking really want walk around live boise much see agony every time try even walking grocery store mention social anxiety disorder leave house alone basically unhappy every way weight one biggest problems must give tea things fight sugar addiction trying eat fruit also love baking sucks know stop unhappy know kind rant wanted express seriousness self esteem issues lot factors play think tmi,sugar addiction killing ,u know fat problem sugar well sugar everything everything yes sweet tooth one problem need people honest something last year one 23 oz arizona green tea almost every day last year half one can 17g sugar per serving making serving 70 calorie number serving per approximately 3 drink one course one day careful diet cut back sugar everything else well exercise best ability due numerous complication able lose weight tea one vice going keep craving sugar make harder resist thing weak take longer lose weight even keep everything else know sugar help keep fat problem seriously need give drink soda juice well soda every often regularly thing drink water nearly much honest civil honest dietition though wish feel like need professional help thing depression make lazier lazy heavy walking hurt shin course want see doctor make sure different problem walking make worse rather find doctor weight something detect make hard exercise eliminates walking really want walk around live boise much see agony every time try even walking grocery store mention social anxiety disorder leave house alone basically unhappy every way weight one biggest problem must give tea thing fight sugar addiction trying eat fruit also love baking suck know stop unhappy know kind rant wanted express seriousness self esteem issue lot factor play think tmi ,sugar addict kill ,us know fat problem sugar well sugar everyth everyth ye sweet tooth one problem need peopl honest someth last year one 23 oz arizona green tea almost everi day last year half one can 17g sugar per serv make serv 70 calori number serv per approxim 3 drink one cours one day care diet cut back sugar everyth els well exercis best abil due numer complic abl lose weight tea one vice go keep crave sugar make harder resist thing weak take longer lose weight even keep everyth els know sugar help keep fat problem serious need give drink soda juic well soda everi often regularli thing drink water nearli much honest civil honest dietit though wish feel like need profession help thing depress make lazier lazi heavi walk hurt shin cours want see doctor make sure differ problem walk make wors rather find doctor weight someth detect make hard exercis elimin walk realli want walk around live bois much see agoni everi time tri even walk groceri store mention social anxieti disord leav hous alon basic unhappi everi way weight one biggest problem must give tea thing fight sugar addict tri eat fruit also love bake suck know stop unhappi know kind rant want express serious self esteem issu lot factor play think tmi

Long  story short, my mom passed away at the beginning of the year and she was  the one who cooked for my father and I. Since she passed, we go out to  eat for almost every meal. As a result of this, I now weigh around 205  lbs and my dad is a bit worse than that. This weight honestly inst  horrible, but ive never weighed over 175 lbs, and my father is starting  to slowly gain a bunch of weight as well.

Basically  what I (26m) want to do is start cooking at home for my father (72m)  and I, instead of going out to eat for every meal. Clearly I've never  cooked in my life, but after losing one parent, I don't want to lose  another due to a poor diet, so I want to get my dad and myself on the  right track to staying healthy. I am trying to see if anyone knows of a  website or a subreddit where they post a healthy menu for every day of  the week, or something along the lines of that, that we can follow. I  honestly just would like to be apart of a community that posts what  everyone will be eating for every day since I haven't the first clue  about diets.

Before anyone asks,  we will be working out on top of what we eat, but the main issue is we  don't have the first clue on where to start dietary wise, lol.

Background:
I'm a 28 year old Male. 6""5 and 164 pounds. I'm skinny, but I I have lots of lean muscle. With my job, i have been walking 25-35k steps 5 days a week for the last 3 years. Plus I walk my dog and play pokemon go like a mofo after work. After the first year my weight has stayed exactly the same, and I look and feel the exact same.

I have found that i need about 5000 calories a day not to feel hungry, and to have energy for the next day of work. I eat a healthy breakfast, a very unhealthy lunch (usually a large sauce drowned shawarma) and a protien packed dinner. I also eat sunflower seeds all day long and snack whenever food is available.

My question is this. With my level of activity, should I be worried about future cardiovascular problems? I wouldn't say I eat healthy on the whole, but I require so so many calories to keep going, I'm not sure how else to do it on my salary.

I have way more fat per day than is recommended by the government of Canada. I'm not looking to lose weight, in fact an extra 30 pounds would be nice (my college weight)

Can anyone here give me their 2 cents on this?

I am also watching my breads and pasta.  I also limited my fried foods.  So Friday I had sweet tea as a treat.  I don’t drink caffeine unless it’s sweet tea and I noticed it helped me during PMS.  So Saturday I went to the zoo with my kid.  It was 90 degrees out and I sweat.  I had water on me and was drinking.   I also ate during the day too.  The next day I am in pain especially my head like I smacked my head or my sinuses were inflamed.  I had pains in my lower back and legs which I understand and didn’t mind.  It’s the massive headache that developed that bothered me.  I had to take 4 Tylenol and ended up resting the entire day.

118,Stuck living with a parent who won't let me diet,"This is a really long story but I'll try to abbreviate it a bit so it doesn't turn into a novel. 

I'm an adult but unable to live alone, at least for now. I'm not usually considered ""overweight"", but may be TOFI. I can't get proper diagnosis right now since I'm in the USA and have no insurance. I don't make much money, and the only job I can get is minimum wage. I failed out of community college years ago. I've had mental illnesses since my early teen years, including depression. I have no energy, motivation, or willpower at all, and any attempts to do anything never succeed. Sometimes I could just lay in bed all day. 

That's a tl;dr of my backstory. The reason I'm on here is because I'm starting to think that changing my diet would lead to the slow change I need to improve my life. Perhaps intaking better foods would give me more energy, which in turn could lead to being able to succeed doing anything else over time. It makes sense to me at least. Worth a try. 

Except, I'm stuck living with my mom. I can't afford to live on my own, and without the energy to finish any education, I can never get a job that would pay enough to do this. I pay for anything car-related (since the car is mine), a few personal bills like my phone, and some of my hygiene products. Mom pays for everything else- housing, food, utilities. 

This is where the problem is. She's only willing to buy food she likes, with a few exceptions. Our diet is junk. But her family has an extremely high metabolism, to the point that they're all borderline underweight regardless of eating junk. I didn't inherit her side's genes, so I'm not the same way. 

I have been bullied for my weight. I was never visually obese, but I've had enough extra to be called fat. Anytime I ever wanted to improve myself- whether it be diet, or buying facial wash for acne, or whatever else- she wouldn't let me. She'd just say *""But you don't need that! You're so smart and handsome and talented""* etc. and go on a tangent about how great I apparently am. 

Nobody else thought any of this. I was always a huge loser with no talents or skills, no friends, I'm ugly as hell... yet she seems to think otherwise, for some reason. 

Even from an early age, I knew she was delusional in thinking all of this. I have a feeling that she was the same as me as a kid, and wanted nothing more in her life than someone to love her. So having kids (after getting a dog and spoiling it) was her plan. 

She won't listen to me saying I want to change or improve anything about my health or body. When doctors tried to diagnose me as on the autism spectrum, she refused to listen to them. She routinely ignores what doctors or other professionals tell her because she thinks she knows everything. Or she'll ask me, and me saying *""I don't know""* isn't a valid answer. 

I know that if I did buy food on my own, she'd cause a huge fuss about it, and maybe even throw some of it away- I've caught her throwing away stuff that I bought before. She refuses to believe anything except her own world view. 

She used to babysit a toddler a couple years ago. His parents bought decent food for him, but my mom would bring junk food over his house and just give him that instead. 

Health stuff means nothing to her, because her own body doesn't react to junk food (at least, on the outside), so she thinks everyone else's should work the same as hers, and she even looks down on heavyset people, who could very well have the same diet as her, or even healthier. 

Also, one last note- it's required that I eat dinner with her on most nights. This has been a thing since I was practically a baby and she'd wake up me and my brother if we were sleeping so that we could keep her company while she ate. Otherwise, she gets very lonely and upset. 

In some ways, I understand her feeding us junk- she worked long hours, got home late, and didn't have time to learn to cook proper meals. But not letting me try to change this later on when I'm more than old enough to do it for myself... idk what to do. 

I'm sorry I just had to vent. All I can do is keep trying to convince her. I don't even know where to begin really since there's so many different diets and I haven't tried any. 

(Also will mention that I've been on anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications. More than I can count. None of them helped my conditions. So the lack of energy may not be depression related. Idk. No insurance, so can't get help medicinally.)",0,stuck living parent let diet,really long story try abbreviate bit turn novel adult unable live alone least usually considered overweight may tofi get

126,How to get back on track and stay there?,"I'm 4'10 and at my heaviest weighed 140lbs. I was over weight for my height and eventually got the motivation to start dieting. I found the subreddits r/vegan1200isplenty and r/1200isplenty which helped tremendously. I ended up being pretty unhealthy though and only ate around 800-900 calories a day for a couple months. I got all the way down to nearly 80 lbs and while I loved the way I looked, I knew my diet was terrible and that I'd eventually become extremely underweight if I continued to eat that way. I did some research and read that to stay the weight I was, I would need to consume 1,400 calories a day. So I tried to stick to that, not being too strict. Letting myself have a donut if I felt like it, but also eating healthy meals throughout the day.

 I'm not quite sure how I ended up where I am now. I'll eat healthy throughout the day, planning my meals the night before. I'll be totally fine and not hungry or anything until bedtime. I end up eating nearly 800 extra calories every night. Sometimes fast food, sometimes another dinner, sometimes just junk like chips and candy. I had to tell my dad to not buy me hot cheetos for a while because I was eating the whole bad in one or two sittings. Before I was able to weigh out all my food and be just fine. But now, even if I weigh it I'll end up reaching for the bag right after. 

I try to be as plant based/vegan as possible. And the stricter I am with that, the better I eat. Nobody else in my family is vegan so if I don't have a ton of vegan junk food, there's none for me to eat. But when I start to loosen up a bit on that, I'll eat everyone else's junk food too...and they have a lot. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get back on track? I've gained a few lbs back and I want to lose them. I don't need to be 80 lbs again. But around 90 would be nice.

135,How to maintain my diet at my new job?,"I'm been doing a mix of low carb dieting and intermittent fasting to help lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

tbh, my diet kindaaa sucks. I have a solid cafe at my current job, where I can get a salad, or a soup, or a wrap or something. But outside of that cafe, I tend to eat low carb fast food. Burgers in lettuce wraps, chinese with veg, zuccini noodles, sub//salad, etc. I just really can't freaking cook. Plus, I have a bit of a night life; so it's not uncommon to be out with friends order wings or some shit.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as intermittent fasting goes, it's all over the place. I've heard that it's important to not get into a rhythm so that your body can't adjust to it. Basically thro out the week I'll have days that I eat normally, don't eat til 12-1, or don't eat until 5(because I hate myself).

&amp;#x200B;

Suprisingly tho, actually been doing pretty good for myself. I've dropped 15-20 pounds in the past few months, and it's been easy to keep it off.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I've got this new job I'm starting next week. It's a really cool position and the company is small and super chill. The thing is, they don't really incorporate a lunch break into there schedule. You get to eat at your desk, and if you want lunch; you just have to let the chief know you're gonna be taking one; and then make up the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, starting a new job, I kinda just want to stick with everyone else's pattern as I ease into the social environment; and it seems like my team's gonna be no lunchers. Which is honestly, pretty cool with me. I mean, I like the idea of eating at my desk and punching out early. And I like what I do, so I'm not really gonna die without a break.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't really know how this is gonna affect my eating schedule or my dieting. A lot of days I'm probbbbably not even going to eat anything. At the most I might manage a TV dinner or something (I seriously cannot cook). Or maybe I'll have a breakfast and then skip lunch. I mean, if I'm engaged in something I tend to zone everything else out; and time just flies by.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just wondering if I'm screwed at all, or if there's anything I should do to maintain or adjust my diet to the new environment.

140,Lazy way to eat Healthy,"I would like to lose weight and I know I can do it.  I was losing weight when I was pregnant with my daughter because I could only eat healthy.  It was grilled chicken and fruits and veggies.  I didn’t have diary or breads and no chocolate and junk food.  My motivation was that If I ate unhealthy I was going to puke.  Once I had my daughter, all that went away and I was able to eat again.  My husband eats like a child.. pop tarts, pizza, etc.  I was starting to eat like him a little bit too much that I gained all the weight I lost back and then some.  I have a very stressful job and I also do the majority of the caretaking.  I also was sick a lot in the beginning.  I know what I need to do but I can’t get my brain to agree and I stress eat.   I already switched out breakfast to a smoothie I make with fruit only instead of the carbs I was eating every day.  I work to cut the breads.. sometimes I don’t eat any bread and sometimes I do.  I was never really big into exercising and need a purpose to move.  I hate routine.  I also have a kid to feed but we usually split meals and she eats way healthier than my husband.  I am just trying to eat better without punishing myself.  Some days I am hungrier than others.  So is there some easy way to do this? I know it’s work.  But maybe I just need to be happy first?

Hello everyone. I’m reaching out because idk what I’m doing. To keep this short, this month marks my 3 year anniversary of lifting weights. I love lifting and I rarely take time off or skip days. Basically, I never truly gave a shit about diet. Now, I’m not an unhealthy eater. I rarely drink alcohol, I don’t drink coffee or soda, and never really eat fast food besides In N Out once every 1-2 months. I realize that I snack a lot though mainly cookies, fruit snacks at work, and lays chips. I also eat A LOT of pasta, meat, fish, etc. I could def eat more veggies. 

I’m doing a test week and cutting out snacks entirely. I lift 3 times a week for 2-3 hrs. And I run for 30-40 mins 2 times a week. 

I don’t wanna keep going forever but I have no idea how to lose weight since I’ve never done it. I feel like Mac from Always Sunny I’m “cultivating mass” for so long I’m fat now lol.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!

153,What will happen with this diet?," 

So, I’m trying to lose a bit of weight. Target 180-190lbs current is around 215-220lbs. I’m 21m and 6’1. I exercise once a week at planet fitness with my gf. (If you have any work out recommendations feel free to share those as well)

DISCLAIMER: this diet might be actually retarded, but that’s because I don’t know what I’m doing. Just trying to avoid fat and carbs (I guess)?

So basically for the last 5 days I’ve been eating chicken tacos as soon as I get home from school/work. The chicken comes from great values cans of chicken. The tortilla shells have a bit of carbs. I don’t add anything other than chipotle sauce or Taco Bell taco seasoning, lettuce, onions and tomato. I have two tacos and that’s all for lunch.

Usually I don’t eat anything till after 9pm which I know is bad, but the only thing I have to eat then is a little starkist pouch of chicken which is like 90 calories.

Sometimes I’ll drink a diet mtn dew.

I assume since I’m eating so little I’m getting a pretty good calorie deficit everyday but idk.

So, how bad am I messing my sh\*t up? Will I lose weight this way? Am I gonna be deficient in some sort of vital vitamin? If so, what should I do instead?

157,Can I eat less and lose weight without better quality food?,"Alright, so I had to do a health screaming at work at though my blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure were all great (Shocking), I'm grossly overweight.  I'm 6'03"", I weigh in the neighborhood of 310lbs.  For the last few years I've maintained this weight by grossly overeating.  I've set a goal to try and get down to 250lbs.  My issue is I hate healthy vegetables, like, all of them.  I've tried seasoning them, adding them to bacon, throwing them in shakes, I can't do it.

So my old diet looked something like this.  Wake up, eat a giant bowl of cereal.  Go to work and eat a double cheeserburger with fries + some candy bar.  Get home, generally snack all day and eat a large dinner (talking like 1500 calories).  This has kept my weight at 310 for about 2 years with 0 exercise. 

In the last week i've cut down to my daily double cheeseburger + fries, a basic meal generally including ground beef + seasoning (around 850 calories) and an apple.  I've found with this, I eat way less over a day but I don't crave food all day, I was literally just bored eating all the time.  I've also started going to the gym 4 days a week for basic cardio and light weights.  I've also cut from 4-6 cans of soda/red bull a day to 0.   I've also started doing pushups, situps, and squats when I don't feel overly sore.  

My question is can I continue to eat the same shitty food, just less of it and lose weight?

158,Seeking tailored weight GAIN diet advice,"I appreciate ANYONE who takes their time to help a random with their problem, so TYIA

I'm 25m  Weight 152 lbs / 69 kg   Height 6 ft / 184 cm

STORY SHORT: I want to gain weight, don't care if fat/muscle. As females predominantly look better slimmer/smaller, the opposite is the same for males. That skinny, exposed-bone look in a male is the guy equivalent of a 'chubby' female - and like anyone wanting to improve their appearance, I just want to NOT look slim, look a bit weighty, fill out clothes better without all that slack., and not feel bone-y to girls I sleep with. No one can escape the psychology of aesthetics, and being skinny provokes this idea of being somewhat less of a 'man', more attributed as 'beta' ...Y'now the type of guy a truck driver wouldn't want to trust to help reverse them into a park. Don't worry, I'm not here for lack of confidence, and I'm happy with 'who' I am and all that. Just want to be a size where I'm not identified as 'skinny'.

I have TRIED in the past to gain 3000cal per day, but after 10+ days or so, I lose willpower, burn out, run out of groceries, or get bored of it. I aimed for 2x 1000cal Shakes daily (Milk,Oats,PB,Chia,Honey,Berrys) + whatever I could eat to cover the remaining 1000.

My top concerns

1. Cost  (assuming appx 3k cal p/day, thats a lot of $, I need to be efficient. Frozen/long life groceries too!)
2. Ease  (In downing it all, prep, &amp; cleaning dishes. Prep and dishes are BIG long term hurdles)
3. Health  (I want to be healthy obviously)
4. Toilet  (Read below)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Having Hirschsprung's disease, frequent and easy toilet visits are a luxury I've never had. IBS symptoms are my norm, so my 'real' version of IBS would prob be your hell. It's completely random when I have the urge or ability to go, but it can be every 7-20 days between visits (I never usually remember the last time I've been). Will this make my weight gain any more difficult/easier??

168,Survey regarding gender and diet/lifestyle choice!," SURVEY IS CLOSED!

Hi there! I'm Marielle and I'm currently doing the IB Diploma Programme in high school.

For my math project, I need to conduct a survey to gather my data. My topic of research is to see if there is a correlation between gender and diet/lifestyle choice.

I have asked to share the survey here, where I strongly appreciate any participation.

If you do want to participate, please read the information under. Ask me if you have any further questions as well!

General info:

* Participation in the research is voluntary.
* All participants that choose to answer the survey do not need to be identified by name. The questions are only focused on gender, age, what country you live in and diet/lifestyle choice.
* The questions marked with a star is obligatory, the rest are optional.
* All information is confidental and the survey is anonymous. You will not be identifiable.
* Participants have the opportunity to find out the results of the survey by contacting me.
* The ""Vegetarian"" option can be chosen whether you are ovo or lacto-ovo. I wasn't precise enough and confused some participants, but since a lot of people have taken the survey already I have decided to let it be.
* Omnivore has been added as an option!

Other info:

* I am aware I have been biased with choosing forums that are vegan/vegetarian based to get the data needed. This is my choice hence the options of either a class of 14 people or the internet.
* I am currently asking around at various forums who aren’t diet/lifestyle specific to get permission to share my survey. Not everyone allows it since it is unrelated to the forum 😊
* This survey includes a non-binary option for gender. The survey is based on a correlation study of genders, which is assumingly in terms of female and male, but I will discuss this with my teacher. I cannot answer how this will unfold right now.
* This is my first time doing a survey online. I am very scared, very anxious, but at the same time excited. I have no serious experience with surveys, so any feedback is nice (if you’re nice too! 😁)

Decided to turn more into plant-based diet because I have diabetes 1 and I want better control of my sugar. I cut out cheese, meat and fish.

greek yogurt 

pears

Berries

Beans

Green leafy vegetables

Tomatoes

Carrots

nectarine

Apples

180,Anyone have a loss of appetite during diet? I hardly feel hunger.,"Hi all,

I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else. 

Monday I started a cleansing diet. My goal was to start a ‘detox’ though I hate that word and gradually build up from there.

Monday I fasted, all I had was homemade vegetable broth. From Tuesday until today (Friday), I ate very small portions of vegetable only foods, including some nuts. I made quinoa paella loaded with veggies, cauliflower rice and veggie stew, sautéed greens, that sort of thing. I just had extremely small portions compared to what I’m used to. 

After my fast day, I lost my appetite. Even though I ate so little, I didn’t feel hungry at all during the day. I’ve never lost my appetite so severely before and am wondering if this is normal? Usually, I’m always hungry throughout the day. Whatever I eat wears off soon and I never feel full. It’s like the total opposite.

Today, I decided to treat myself to my favorite Thai dish from my favorite restaurant, and I couldn’t even finish it I got so full.

199,Taro root in diet seems to be helping me lose weight fairly quickly,"Hello everyone,

I am someone with a number of health issues, minor obesity, hypertension, digestive issues, fatty liver, joint problems and such. I read in [this study](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2032/2e4f6e09ec2dac0a1dbba2a99bc75e7ff0da.pdf) (particularly pages 24-25) that Taro could help with nearly all of these issues due to its high fiber, iron, calcium, potassium, protein and other mineral contents, as well as being very low in fat. That said, there are some unhealthy things about it, such as being high in carbohydrates, and some other slightly toxic nutrients(which can be removed upon proper preparation and cooking which I believe most stores will provide such prepared versions). So, usually Taro being in your normal, everyday diet is not recommended(but otherwise fine now and then and esp if prepared right) due to some of the other health risks it can pose unless you're already someone who has some or more of those conditions I mentioned, which I am, and is considered safer for people with these issues, especially when prepared properly.

Anyways, that's enough on what has been found studying it, I decided to start having a serving of taro every day about 3 weeks ago. Since starting it, I've felt a lot of health benefits, at the very least, and I know I've lost 10 pounds already! (also, losing weight is more likely in people with those conditions I said, otherwise due to the high carbs, it could cause weight gain in people who don't have the above conditions, just want to make it clear that you should be careful if you want to try it out and make sure you fit the profile of someone who could benefit). I've also noticed improvement in my digestive health(though at first, it had several days of increasing my bowel movements by 5 times as much, which was insane, but started to become more reasonable recently, this is known to happen though, since Taro has antioxidants).

So yeah, if you're someone with a few of those same conditions, I would recommend it so far, but it is a little early nonetheless.

205,Does getting your drink without ice/extra ice effect calorie count?,"A large 32oz coke from Sonic is 270 calories.

A 12oz can of coke is 140 calories.

If we're going by pure ounces, the 32oz coke from Sonic should be closer to 375 calories. This means Sonic (and most likely other restaurants are taking into account the ice offsetting the volume of the drink. This is important because if you order your drinks with light ice, or no ice, you're likely consuming a lot more calories that you might not be accounting for, but if you order them with extra ice, you might end up with fewer.

By doing the math the Sonic large with ice looks to only contain about 72% per volume of the beverage itself. We can check for other sizes as well, route 44 contains about 70% drink/30% ice, but a medium contains about 77% drink to ice ratio. Most of these are probably off, so for ease of remembering a round number we could assume 75%?

What this means is that if you get your drink with no ice you need to take the calorie count of the drink and divide it by .75 (dividing by a fraction makes the number bigger not smaller) to get your actual count.

So that route 44 360 calorie coke with no ice is actually probably closer to 480 calories.

I have had one hell of a day and decided to get pizza for dinner as I figured I would eat poorly... I also had a sushi buffet for lunch (5 rolls, 2 pieces of crab, and a Miso Soup...), but figured today is just shot. The greater issue? My lady was closing from her job at Dunkin Donuts where she was able to bring quite a bit of stuff home... so add that to 4 pieces of pizza and 5 miniature bread sticks... Now mind you... I am not someone who is overly big. My BFP is about 35%, which is medically obese but I'm also a pretty athletically built guy (Like a linebacker), but I do have some extra fat that I want to lose.  


In my depressed stated, I wanted to get some advice on meal prep and gym work.... Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Some questions:

\-- What should my workouts consist of and for how long (I can't run long distances due to a shin issue)?  
\-- Should I go to the gym every day, every other day, or...?  
\-- My meal prep (below) is pretty high in sodium... Should I be truly concerned? (I'm early 20s)  


My usual Meal Prep (that I need to stick to more):  
\-- Uncle Ben's Rice  
\-- Bird's Eye Vegetables (Broccoli, Asparagus, Brussel Spouts)  
\-- Steak Fajitas (John Soules)   
\-- Sweet Potatos  
\-- Lean Ground turkey (I brown it and simmer it in Salsa)  
\-- Chicken Breast

209,Question about fat intake while carb cycling,"Hi guys, so the good news is I just finished the first month of my 3 month cutting phase and I'm down 12 pounds (210&gt;198). my Ideal weight is between 175-180. I would like to keep this progress going strong, so I had some questions related to fat intake. Overall, I keep a calorie deficit of about 800 calories per day. I carb cycle throughout the week, Monday-Wednesday low carb, Thursday medium carb, Friday and Saturday low carb, and then high carb on Sunday. This is mostly so that I keep my insulin and lectin levels high and so that I can hopefully retain my lean mass while cutting.

So as a college kid on a budget, it's been somewhat hard to keep fat intake down on low carb days. My macro goals in percentages are 40% protein, 40% fat, and 20% carbs. Because I don't have enough money to spend on chicken every day, I get a lot of my protein from eggs because they are the cheapest source (I think). I also mix my protein shakes with Greek yogurt for an extra protein boost. At the end of the day however, I always seem to have to eat more of my precious chicken or take an extra scoop of protein to even out my macros so that fat isn't the highest. It's also been somewhat hard to keep my calories HIGH enough on low carb days because of the amount of protein I need to eat (protein sources tend to be low in calories and I don't want to create too much of a deficit.) 

So I guess my overall question is, what other low fat protein sources do you guys use, and also, how important is it really to be wary of fat intake on low carb days (I understand the necessity of keeping fat intake low on high carb days)? Keep in mind that cost is somewhat of an issue. If there really is no other solution, I'll just suck it up and stock up on more chicken.",0,question fat intake carb cycling,hi guys good news finished first month 3 month cutting phase 12 pounds 210 198 ideal weight 175 180 would like keep progress going strong questions related fat intake overall keep calorie deficit 800 calories per day carb cycle throughout week monday wednesday low carb thursday medium carb friday saturday low carb high carb sunday mostly keep insulin lectin levels high hopefully retain lean mass cutting college kid budget somewhat hard keep fat intake low carb days macro goals percentages 40 protein 40 fat 20 carbs enough money spend chicken every day get lot protein eggs cheapest source think also mix protein shakes greek yogurt extra protein boost end day however always seem eat precious chicken take extra scoop protein even macros fat highest also somewhat hard keep calories high enough low carb days amount protein need eat protein sources tend low calories want create much deficit guess overall question low fat protein sources guys use also important really wary fat intake low carb days understand necessity keeping fat intake low high carb days keep mind cost somewhat issue really solution suck stock chicken,question fat intake carb cycling ,hi guy good news finished first month 3 month cutting phase 12 pound 210 198 ideal weight 175 180 would like keep progress going strong question related fat intake overall keep calorie deficit 800 calorie per day carb cycle throughout week monday wednesday low carb thursday medium carb friday saturday low carb high carb sunday mostly keep insulin lectin level high hopefully retain lean mass cutting college kid budget somewhat hard keep fat intake low carb day macro goal percentage 40 protein 40 fat 20 carbs enough money spend chicken every day get lot protein egg cheapest source think also mix protein shake greek yogurt extra protein boost end day however always seem eat precious chicken take extra scoop protein even macro fat highest also somewhat hard keep calorie high enough low carb day amount protein need eat protein source tend low calorie want create much deficit guess overall question low fat protein source guy use also important really wary fat intake low carb day understand necessity keeping fat intake low high carb day keep mind cost somewhat issue really solution suck stock chicken ,question fat intak carb cycl ,hi guy good news finish first month 3 month cut phase 12 pound 210 198 ideal weight 175 180 would like keep progress go strong question relat fat intak overal keep calori deficit 800 calori per day carb cycl throughout week monday wednesday low carb thursday medium carb friday saturday low carb high carb sunday mostli keep insulin lectin level high hope retain lean mass cut colleg kid budget somewhat hard keep fat intak low carb day macro goal percentag 40 protein 40 fat 20 carb enough money spend chicken everi day get lot protein egg cheapest sourc think also mix protein shake greek yogurt extra protein boost end day howev alway seem eat preciou chicken take extra scoop protein even macro fat highest also somewhat hard keep calori high enough low carb day amount protein need eat protein sourc tend low calori want creat much deficit guess overal question low fat protein sourc guy use also import realli wari fat intak low carb day understand necess keep fat intak low high carb day keep mind cost somewhat issu realli solut suck stock chicken

219,Looking for a site or reddit that shares diet progress blogs?,"Anyone remember blog rings? I am looking for something like that.  
Is there a reddit or site that is just a depot of blogs of people's daily weight loss journals?

Or do people just share their things on general social media platforms and hashtag everything?

I am really sick of all the tech issues with my instagram acct and it just makes me want to look anywhere else. 

Facebook - no...its just not the droids im looking for - everytime i get spammed with things or have security issues or magically get spam mails I opted out of etc

Twitter - not really a good place to journal

Tumblr - they like to delete ""diet blogs"" calling it disordered without checking content - f0king annoying

220,Losing Weight,"I'm a female, 163cm, 64kg, asian. I am too fat and I wanna lose weight. I tried to keep track on how much i eat. I was unable to cook but i learn to make simple food so I would know whats in my food to count how much calories i ate (1000cal a day with having some days as exceptions so i wont be too stressed out). I was 73kgs at some point but with what i did, i lose like 8kgs and i thought it was enough to keep losing weight.

Problem is, I love food, when i get stressed out, i wont be able to feel full at all and i could keep eating for the whole day and i would still want more. But then i would feel guilty and get even more stressed out. I kept track when i was in holiday so everything was fine, now that i need to do my last project, i am sooo stressed out and i ate a bucket of chicken only for lunch and i still want more. with that, the next day i only eat fruits and it stressed me out even more now with uni and all but i managed to weight 63,7kgs once with empty stomach but once i eat, i got back to 64+kgs.

I weight myself today before uni and i weight 64,2kgs, ate 2 meatballs as my breakfast and a starbucks drink as my lunch with peanut butter panini (it was on discount). so its roughly 930cals so no dinner for me (usually i ate lunch and dinner only, but i cant resist the meatballs). even so, i weight myself just now (i ate like 5h ago) and i weight 64,8kgs. so tomorrow i will weight roughly 64,5kgs IF i dont eat tonight, so i gained weight. Also, I dont poop daily, if that even matter.

I used to weight 60kgs but all i ate was seaweed and a cup of rice, twice a day, which is roughly around 600cals a day and when i felt bad, i would eat mini ice cream, which is almost 200cals. Even with that, i was stuck at 60kgs to 61kgs and i wanted to lose more (but shit happened thats why i gained a lot after that).

Idk what to do to lose more weight, atm there are lots and lots of pressure to lose weight but lots of things stressed me out as well. There are days i wanna say ""fuck this"" and buy a big cake and big pizza to eat FROM THE MIDDLE because fuck everything and fuck the rules, but i didnt and ended up just looking at them and watch people eat food and starve myself because i want them too.

Whats a good way to lose weight without working out? I dont want everyone to ask me wtf did i eat so i became too fat or not allowed to sit in a car for being too fat anymore. Please help out if you know. I'm so tempted to only eat 3 pieces of flavored almond a day to lose weight but i also wanna eat normal food, it might stress me out and make me eat a bunch more.",0,losing weight,female 163cm 64kg asian fat wanna lose weight tried keep track much eat unable cook learn make simple food would know whats food count much calories ate 1000cal day days exceptions wont stressed 73kgs point lose like 8kgs thought enough keep losing weight problem love food get stressed wont able feel full could keep eating whole day would still want would feel guilty get even stressed kept track holiday everything fine need last project sooo stressed ate bucket chicken lunch still want next day eat fruits stressed even uni managed weight 63 7kgs empty stomach eat got back 64 kgs weight today uni weight 64 2kgs ate 2 meatballs breakfast starbucks drink lunch peanut butter panini discount roughly 930cals dinner usually ate lunch dinner cant resist meatballs even weight ate like 5h ago weight 64 8kgs tomorrow weight roughly 64 5kgs dont eat tonight gained weight also dont poop daily even matter used weight 60kgs ate seaweed cup rice twice day roughly around 600cals day felt bad would eat mini ice cream almost 200cals even stuck 60kgs 61kgs wanted lose shit happened thats gained lot idk lose weight atm lots lots pressure lose weight lots things stressed well days wanna say fuck buy big cake big pizza eat middle fuck everything fuck rules didnt ended looking watch people eat food starve want whats good way lose weight without working dont want everyone ask wtf eat became fat allowed sit car fat anymore please help know tempted eat 3 pieces flavored almond day lose weight also wanna eat normal food might stress make eat bunch,losing weight ,female 163cm 64kg asian fat wan na lose weight tried keep track much eat unable cook learn make simple food would know whats food count much calorie ate 1000cal day day exception wont stressed 73kgs point lose like 8kgs thought enough keep losing weight problem love food get stressed wont able feel full could keep eating whole day would still want would feel guilty get even stressed kept track holiday everything fine need last project sooo stressed ate bucket chicken lunch still want next day eat fruit stressed even uni managed weight 63 7kgs empty stomach eat got back 64 kg weight today uni weight 64 2kgs ate 2 meatball breakfast starbucks drink lunch peanut butter panini discount roughly 930cals dinner usually ate lunch dinner cant resist meatball even weight ate like 5h ago weight 64 8kgs tomorrow weight roughly 64 5kgs dont eat tonight gained weight also dont poop daily even matter used weight 60kgs ate seaweed cup rice twice day roughly around 600cals day felt bad would eat mini ice cream almost 200cals even stuck 60kgs 61kgs wanted lose shit happened thats gained lot idk lose weight atm lot lot pressure lose weight lot thing stressed well day wan na say fuck buy big cake big pizza eat middle fuck everything fuck rule didnt ended looking watch people eat food starve want whats good way lose weight without working dont want everyone ask wtf eat became fat allowed sit car fat anymore please help know tempted eat 3 piece flavored almond day lose weight also wan na eat normal food might stress make eat bunch ,lose weight ,femal 163cm 64kg asian fat wan na lose weight tri keep track much eat unabl cook learn make simpl food would know what food count much calori ate 1000cal day day except wont stress 73kg point lose like 8kg thought enough keep lose weight problem love food get stress wont abl feel full could keep eat whole day would still want would feel guilti get even stress kept track holiday everyth fine need last project sooo stress ate bucket chicken lunch still want next day eat fruit stress even uni manag weight 63 7kg empti stomach eat got back 64 kg weight today uni weight 64 2kg ate 2 meatbal breakfast starbuck drink lunch peanut butter panini discount roughli 930cal dinner usual ate lunch dinner cant resist meatbal even weight ate like 5h ago weight 64 8kg tomorrow weight roughli 64 5kg dont eat tonight gain weight also dont poop daili even matter use weight 60kg ate seawe cup rice twice day roughli around 600cal day felt bad would eat mini ice cream almost 200cal even stuck 60kg 61kg want lose shit happen that gain lot idk lose weight atm lot lot pressur lose weight lot thing stress well day wan na say fuck buy big cake big pizza eat middl fuck everyth fuck rule didnt end look watch peopl eat food starv want what good way lose weight without work dont want everyon ask wtf eat becam fat allow sit car fat anymor pleas help know tempt eat 3 piec flavor almond day lose weight also wan na eat normal food might stress make eat bunch

226,Questions About Diet While Cutting,"Hey guys, so I'm in junior in college and just stared going back to the gym. I was pretty fit in highschool (all state linebacker), but my freshmen 15 kinda turned into my freshmen 40. Currently, I've been back at the gym for a month now with my primary focus on cutting. As of now, I've dropped about 10 pounds (205&lt;195). I've been carb cycling with a plan of Monday-Wednesday being low carb, a med carb day on Thursday, Friday-Saturday low carb, and high carb on Sunday. I lift 5 days a week and do cardio 3 days a week. My biggest concern is with my calorie intake. I'm currently capping myself off at 1500 cals a day except for on my high carb day where that goes up to about 2000 (healthy sources). I know that this is really low and I don't want to wreck my metabolism. While I believe I'm a heavier mesomorph, I'm still a bit carb sensitive so I've been afraid to up my calorie intake, but does anyone have any idea what a better calorie goal would be for me? Keep in mind that I haven't felt hungry and I've adapted to this calorie range, so it's not a matter of not being able to maintain my current diet. If I'm doing things right, simply feel free to put my concerns at rest. But would it be safer to up my calorie intake to around 2000 in order to keep my metabolism a roaring fire? I plan to keep cutting while trying my best to retain lean mass for another 2-3 months and then upping my calorie intake for bulking after that. Any feedback on my current plan would be much appreciated. I would talk to a dietician, but as a college kid, and don't have that kind of money to drop for a consultation.

233,How do I start,"I'm in kind of a predicament.  


I'm currently 15 and I was never forced to eat healthy. As a young kid, I ate whatever I wanted, and now that I'm starting to think about what the hell will happen to me when my metabolism dies down, I'm realizing that maybe my diet shouldn't primarily consist of junk food. I basically only drink soft drinks and my meals primarily consist of noodles. I'm making it a goal to completely cut soft drinks from my diet at least, and to start drinking actual water (god that sounds bad). In hindsight I find myself thinking after my fourth can of soda of the day, 'it's not as bad as some people, fuck it', and downing the thing only to find myself craving another. I'm picky with foods and find myself gagging at certain cooked vegetables. I'm sure I have some deficiencies in some areas, and I'm thinking of seeing a nutritionist (y/n?). Does anyone have any advice on how I can start changing my mindset, gaining motivation to eat healthier and what actions I should take to avoid unhealthy foods? How do I stay committed?

I'm sick of feeling like shit and looking like a sickly leukemia patient on their first week of chemo. I don't wanna become a diseased, miserable, unmotivated sack with countless heart and liver problems. If I'm set on avoiding making bad decisions early in life, then maybe I should turn this around as well.

238,"Dieting, starving and psychology: help?","This is... long, and definitely embarrassing, and possibly in the wrong subreddit, so bear with me. 

I've been overweight ever since I hit puberty, more or less, and I've really struggled with it. I wore plain baggy clothes growing up--no makeup, didn't do a whole lot with my hair (other than keeping it clean and brushed). I never went on a date, held hands, or kissed anyone, because I thought I was too gross and flabby to have a boyfriend. 

My parents came down pretty hard on this. They restricted food at home, and so I would sneak out to get chocolate chips and hide it in my bag coming home as I ran up to my bedroom. I went on Weight Watchers, and then Jenny Craig, and then Weight Watchers again. They'd constantly monitor my progress, and constantly watch/comment on what I ate, and cry and tell me worrying about my health (diabetes, a heart attack) would keep them up at night. 

I developed a brief stint during Jenny Craig where I would starve myself for two days, weigh in to get the lower numbers on the scale, and then binge on all the fatty food--chocolate and ham-and-cheese croissant sandwiches. That was a cycle that lasted for a few months, but it screwed up my digestion for a while.

All of this leads to right now, when I signed up for a new weight loss program. It was advertised as ""making lifestyle choices"", which, fantastic! I'm exercising more now, and I want to adjust my eating. Then I got a binder full of foods I could and couldn't eat, and a food journal, and it sounds stupid but I started crying right in the office and had to pinch myself to stop. 

I know I have issues surrounding eating, and control over what I eat, but where do I start?

240,Starting over...,"First of all I wanna say I was wondering earlier if there was a subreddit like this, and then it popped up in a different sub, so thanks internet for being creepy once again. 

Anyway, some backstory. Two years ago, I lost about 45 lbs. in about 5 months. Looked great, felt great. Spent 2+ hours at the gym 6 days a week, and cut out all fast food and sugar (except dark chocolate), but other than that I pretty much ate whatever I wanted. I suspect the rapid weight loss was due to all the working out rather than the diet itself. However, just when I looked the best I ever had, I began a very intensive healthcare program at my school. I was constantly in class or studying. I also quit my full-time desk job for a part-time retail job in order to work during school. So between class, studying, and work, I definitely wasn't able to hit the gym the way I had been. I tried, but my grades suffered the first semester because of it. Then came the drinking, clubbing, and partying. Made a ton of new friends in school and we were ""rewarding"" ourselves every weekend by getting totally shit-faced for all our hard work during the week. So as you can imagine, the weight slowly came back. Fast forward to now, I'm at my original weight from two years ago. I'm so disappointed in myself for allowing this to happen. Now that I'm graduated and in my field, there's just no way I'll have time or energy to spend all those hours at the gym. I definitely plan to go back, but I know I need to focus more on the diet aspect this time if I want to lose weight again. 

So here's my problem: I'm really fucking picky. I've tried so many ""healthy"" options and I just hate a lot of it. I'm looking for suggestions on how to either force myself to eat it anyway, or food that tastes good and is good for you. My other issue is lack of motivation. My life has been totally turned upside down since I graduated, and it's really hard for me to cope, even though it's a good thing. Unfortunately, I've been eating my feelings all summer so I'm just totally depressed about being back to square one. Only I can bring back my motivation, I know. But perhaps some of you kind souls can make a few suggestions pertaining to anything in this post. I know it's a long one.

241,Lost Motivation Again,"So at the beginning of this year I (M27) realised I had a big holiday booked to go to Florida,

I wasn't over weight, but I was a bit porkier than I used to be, so decided New Years day I would go on a diet, and get into shape, and in 5 months I lost 2 and a half stone, I was so god damn proud of myself, I had never felt better about myself. the best I had felt in along time.

(Gym everyday, Three in proportion meals everyday with no snacks)

As much as you try to eat healthy on holiday, it never seems to work especially in a place like USA.

I got back and I had only put on half a stone, which wasn't to bad I didn't think. BUT WHAT WAS IN MAY

I've started a new job up in London so I do a lot of commuting and getting back late, where as before I was close to home and managed to get home early to go the gym

since then I am slowly gaining weight again and can't seem to get it off this time no matter what I try. if anything I think I have lost the motivation.

I now have a holiday to Australia in 2 months and feel I need to get back into shape, seeing that I don't want to be the ""FAT"" one out of my friends.

so I need advice, I know now its harder for me to work out and I need to regain the motivation I used to have.

Has anyone got any tips and tricks to help with being healthy, working out on a commuter lifestyle?

Or a helpful plan that can help in those two months to loose weight.

Anything will help

261,My diet for past 2 months,"All my friends are sick of me talking about my diet, but it's working and I'm the lowest weight I've been in 10 years. 

At the beginning of July I really didn't want to make anything for dinner so I stopped by Subway and got a salad. Lettuce, Tomato, Cucumber, Green Peppers, Red Onions, Pickles, and Black Olives with Olive Oil and Red Wine Vinegar for the dressing. Extra Vinegar. It tasted really good and filled me up. Next thing I know I'm eating the same salad every day for a week, and when I stepped on my scale one morning the needle was below 250lbs. I was like hmmm, did my laziness accidentally put me on a diet that works? So for the rest of July I would eat like a burrito bowl, or some kind of Rice Bowl for lunch every day \~\~ 1,000 calories worth of food, and then have the salad for dinner. \~\~300-400 calories with some random healthy snacks throughout the day, apples, pears, peaches, etc. On top of that I drink about a 1/2 gallon of water in the morning another 1/2 throughout the day, and another 1/2 in the evening. I cut out all sugar, bread, and all refined carbohydrates (don't know if white rice counts in this category though, but I still eat rice) 

So today marks the end of 2 months of this diet. I don't get hungry, I can't eat anywhere near as much food as I used to, and am not really craving anything (Even though a rep brought into my office the best tasting oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten. Yes, if you put a plate of cookies in front of me I'll lose all self control.)

I don't know if this will help anyone else, but it's worked for me so far. To celebrate this 2 months of dieting, I'm going to continue for 2 more months. Also my eating habits before were insane. I would eat like a 2,000 calorie dinner some nights. 16oz ribeye, 8oz Italian Sausage, 10oz Brussel Sprouts.

269,Hard time dieting,"Hi there! I've been struggling with some extra kilos gain in the past 5 years, actually ever since my mom passed plus me being in college made me eat mindlessly. Also, when I am around someone who doesn't diet or just eats poorly, I just can't help myself and I start eating along whatever, whenever. I can't really stick to any diet, although I've lost weight in the past so I kinda know what to do, but now I can't be constant about it.

I've been trying to diet in the past year(calorie deficit diet), I lost some weight, maintained it for a while, but put it back after spoiling my eating habits over and over again. 
So, here's the problem: it's really hard for me to lose weight at this point and it's so frustrating.  How can I keep myself motivated and stop messing with a healthy eating habbit once I get there? I would like to get around 50 kgs so I can feel healthy and fit well in my clothes again, I know that 3-4 kgs don't mean much and don't seem that hard to lose.

I just picked up the book.   
Is this diet allowed to be discussed here?  It is from a doctor so I didn't know if it got a pass from the 1200 posting rule.  
Don't think the 800 calories goes on an on either but I haven't finished the book yet.  


Diet in a nutshell:

*""The Fast 800 diet prescribes a low-calorie diet of 800 calories a day for at least the first two weeks, and then progresses to what Mosley calls ""the new 5:2 diet"": on fasting days, followers limit their intake to 800 calories and also eat all their meals within a 10-hour window every day (a regimen called time-restricted feeding).""*

286,Is a Low Fat High Carb diet a good solution for my problem (explained in more detail below)?,"I've been looking for a good, nutritional diet for me that helps me lose some weight (not much), keep me energized and don't make me feel sickly.

I've tried some diets before.
Intervall fasting, low carb (or calorie counting) and they all make me feel weak, sick and kind of nausea.
I feel like I'm missing out on nutrition.

I like almost all kinds of fruits, but I am really picky about vegetables (I hate tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc).

So from what I can take away from reading about this Low Fat High Carb diet is that I just eat a bunch of vegetables and fruits I like, plus either potatoes, rice, beans or whole wheat pasta.


Is this nutritional enough without supplements?

And if it's not nutritional enough, what would I need to add to make it a healthy diet?

(To ad some additional information about me: I only drink water, tea and milk. I don't eat junk food at all. I like to eat some salads as well, with very little dressing. I stay away from sweets, but not completely quitting it.. but regulated, not much at all in comparison to child me. I am doing sports, not crazy much.

\- Usually stick to a 16/8 fast: stop eating at 4...then eat 8ish the next day. 

\- Usually drink around 20+ cups of water or tea a day (8oz). Green tea - nothing added and only a few cups of that

\- Start off the morning with an 8oz cup of Athletic Greens daily suppliment

\- Breakfast: one package of instant oatmeal mixed with chia seeds and cinnamon...set over night with a cup of water. Microwave and then mix with frozen blueberries

\- Snacks: (sugar is an issue when its around but try to limit that), mostly nuts or fruits I bring. 

\-Lunch: usually a PB sandwich on whole wheat bread (with cinnamon). Plus some fruit or vegetable like carrots or celary. 

\- Late lunch / last meal of the day: fruit or vegetable and 3 protein bites that I make at home (mix of PB, Flaxmeal, chia seeds, tumeric, honey and other stuff).

300,In need of tips or advice for diets or healthy options for a better life.,"My wife and me have decided it’s finally time to start getting into better shape and getting our bodies healthy as we start thinking about the future and kids on the horizon. For me I’m 6’3 weighing close to 220lbs but most of it my unnecessary weight is around my midsection as I’ve developed quite the gut. My wife is 5’6 and 140 and she complains as well about her midsection which is our main thing we want to get rid of. We will be starting to work out as well but the main focus is to work on eating healthy and losing weight before getting hardcore into working out. 

I have a shellfish allergy which hinders some meals and diets I would believe help so any tips that don’t involve shellfish is greatly appreciated as well.

303,How to stay full/feel more satsified?,"Apologies for cross posting on other subs, I'm an almost-vegetarian and thought I had it down pat until recently.

For health reasons I've been an almost-vegetarian for the last 7 months, and need to be on a low-sodium diet (salt intolerance= severe bloating+discomfort). By ""almost-vegetarian"" I mostly eat just veggies and carbs, some fruit, but sometimes can eat a small amount of meat (too much gives me nausea/indigestion). Oh a d nothing deep fried as that doesn't seem to agree with me either. At the beginning I had no idea what I was doing really, and just threw together a veggie meal anyhow. This has worked for me so far. But lately my appetite has increased abit, and I think if I don't inc some protein/fibre rich veggies then I will still feel abit hungry after eating. 

I'm calorie counting with a fitbit just to see what I consume and how many calories, and it's definitely going up.

Tonight I had shop bought fishcake with sauce in centre, and homemade vegetable toad-in-the-hole. I had the other quarter of the toad so basically half of what was made 😅.

316,"High-protein, quick to cook meal plan","Hey all. I'm skinny-fat.

I've had problems getting out of this predicament for the last year, ever since I realized how bad the situation was. By my most recent estimates, I'm 25-30% fat, weighing in at \~88kg at 178cm height. I'm pretty much on the border between Overweight and Obese at this point.

In order to fix this, I need to hit the gym, and I need to hit it hard. I've been trying on-and-off to do this for the last year, trying out strength-building programs like Starting Strength, StorngLifts 5x5 and Greyskull LP. But they haven't given me much result, and I blame this mostly on my diet, or lack thereof.

It's pretty bad, I don't have time to cook anything. I'm a software engineer, so that means a 9-5 office job, leaving me with very little time over the week. Even less when you account for the fact that 3 days a week I try to go to the gym. Furthermore, weekends I usually have to work on personal projects, and it's really hard to find the time to cook anything at all.

318,10 Ways To Lose Weight Fast in 2020,"1. **Eat plenty of fruit and veg** Fruit and veg are low in calories and fat, and high in fibre – 3 essential ingredients for successful weight loss. They also contain plenty of vitamins and minerals.**You can get the List of Best Fruit &amp; vegetables**
2. Top 7 Vegetables for Weigh Loss📷
3. **Drink plenty of water** People sometimes confuse thirst with hunger. You can end up consuming extra calories when a glass of water is really what you need. 📷
4. **Quit Drinking Habit** A Regular glass of wine can contain as many calories as a piece of chocolate. Over time, drinking too much can easily contribute to weight gain 📷
5. **Consume More Grains** By Replacing whole grains for refined grains like white bread, cakes, cookies, and pretzels, you add much-needed fibre and will fill up faster so you’re more likely to eat a reasonable portion. 📷
6. **Stop Eating Late Night** Establish a time when you will stop eating so you won’t give in to the late-night munchies or mindless snacking while watching television and brush your teeth before going to bed.📷
7. **Tracking your diet and exercise** If someone wants to lose weight, they should be aware of everything that they eat and drink each day. The most effective way to do this is to log every item that they consume, in either a journal or an online food tracker. 📷
8. **Getting a good Sleep** Research suggests that insufficient or poor-quality sleep slows down the process in which the body converts calories to energy, called metabolism. When metabolism is less effective, the body may store unused energy as fat. In addition, poor sleep can increase the production of insulin and cortisol, which also prompt fat storage. 📷
9. **Stress Management** When people are under constant stress, cortisol can remain in the bloodstream for longer, which will increase there appetite and potentially lead to them eating more.
10. **EXERCISE—BUT NOT EXCESSIVELY** Don’t get me wrong — exercising at any time is good for you. But evening activity may be particularly beneficial because many people’s metabolism slows down toward the end of the day. Thirty minutes of aerobic activity before dinner increases your metabolic rate and may keep it elevated for another two or three hours, even after you’ve stopped moving. Plus, it’ll help you relax post-meal so you won’t be tempted by stress-induced grazing that can rack up calories\*.\* 📷
11. **Start Taking coffee** Start your day with a Cup Of coffee. Caffeine is a natural diuretic *and* an excellent source of antioxidants, which protect your cells from damage. You can have up to 400 mg — daily, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. You can Also have Herbal coffee Which will help you to avoid sugar as well.

It worked well for a year, but after that cheating became easier and easier until i was back at the starting point.

Chemicals
Refined food
Artificial food
Processed food

419,I'm addicted to uber eats and stress eating and I don't know what to do,"1. I live alone, no one to judge
2. I work remotely from home
3. I get paid enough that it doesn't hurt to order food willy nilly, but it does damage my saving capacity *a lot*

&amp;#x200B;

I have bad untreatable sleep deprivation, on rare nights where I sleep well I wake up without feeling so overwhelmingly addicted to bad food, but this is a part of my life and always will be. It also ruins my metabolism and I am pretty much fat now.

I have this awful habit of getting mentally fatigued from work then flopping down on the couch, turning on the TV, and ordering food.

And here's the kicker - once it gets bad, and it does, several times a day - I don't even care about weight loss *or weight gain* or money or anything, I just need the food. Its a real addiction and I have no way to combat it.

I have a car, I'm near a supermarket, I cook exceptionally well, but I can't bring myself to do it. I also can't work until I eat something bad because it constantly screams in my mind to do it. If I don't, I can't focus or anything. I've gone away from civilization for a few days, where I couldn't get back to it if I wanted to (rained in, dirt roads), its torture and I come out feeling awful, but with a more positive attitude that just doesn't last.

I went on a ketogenic diet and my body fat went down to 8%!!! And then ramped all the way back up to 30%+ because the moment I touch anything bad all the addiction rushes back into my system.

424,Is It Possible To Remain Thin While Still Enjoying Rich Food Everyday?,"So I have this philosophy: Instead of counting calories, watching out for sugar, torturing yourself by eating only salads and paying so much attention to your diet.......why not just eat what you want and compensate by increasing your metabolism via your lifestyle?

&amp;#x200B;

These lifestyle choices would include: lifting weights daily and gaining muscle, never sitting on a chair for more than 1 hour......remaining mobile throughout the day so you're always on the move and keeping your blood flowing and metabolism up, having a fair bit of walking exercise throughout the day, etc. You get the point. Just don't be sedentary. Be as anti sedentary as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

And by rich food, I mean food which is still nutritious but not lean - fatty meat like bacon, butter on toast, fried eggs, hamburgers, etc. These kinds of foods really satisfy the taste buds and still offer nutritious value.....but they come at a price (it's not really good for sedentary people). I think bodybuilders refer to this kind of diet as '' dirty bulking ''.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't exactly junk food. Junk food is food which is genuinely useless and offers no  value except for taste (like a chocolate bar).

425,Salt and grease sensitivity in gut,"Hi all. Are there any dieticians in the house?? Need some advice. About six months ago I had to change my diet due to some minor surgery that I've had. I ended up using the whole supply of pain relieving morphine that I was given afterwards. Post-surgery I've become extremely sensitive to anything with too much salt/fat/grease and/or if it's too rich. Initially it caused extreme discomfort in my gut, and often would make my abdomen heat up like a furnace and also had hot soles in feet and hands. Felt like a hot fever but without the sweat. This used to either wake me up in middle of the night, or prevent me from falling asleep in the first place. After speaking with my nice GP and the nurse from my ward in the hospital, both simply said to take regular pain meds should this happen again because - surprise surprise - nobody knows why it happens! Recently discovered nettle leaf tea seems to help if I eat something too salty. Also had another bout of hot soles and restless sleep for no apparent reason.

Through a very painstakingly long trial and error, and using a symptom app, I've come to the conclusion the symptoms and discomfort happens after I've ingested too much salt/grease/rich/deep fried foods. I just dont know *why* . My family aren't very understanding or supportive, tend to act as though I'm just being supremely fussy. They won't even try to properly understand or learn what to make what's ok for me to eat when we do eat together. We are Chinese so my mums cooking is pretty much steeped in salt/salty sauces. My gut's feeling better in past few months since I pretty much make all my meals myself now.

The time and date the symptoms happen vary wildly. Another GP actually said to me ""what do you want me to do?! There's nothing physically wrong with you!"". As a result of my new diet, I've also become and almost-vegetarian; I can only eat tiny amounts of meat, my gut feels best if I mainly eat veggies and surpringly dairy, carbs, nuts, seeds, fruit and sugar are no problem at all.

426,How to feel fuller?,"I'm doing a ""simple"" diet which mostly consists of counting my calories. 

I'm eating more veggies (salads mainly) and less meat (either smaller portions or substituting it to vegan alternatives).

I could eat fruits as snacks but when I did that, I was only full for another hour.

438,Do I have to tell my sister or anybody when I'm off my diet? Also if it is something to get angry about if I didn't tell beforehand?,"EDIT: Thank you so much for the replies! I'm not sure if I mentioned this in my post but I would like to add a question: Does a person lose immense credibility for not telling anybody(who they might have casually said they are dieting to) that they stopped dieting on the day they do?

----------------
Hello, this is my first post. I apologise if I got this post in the wrong place 😭 This issue might seem very trivial but I'd like to hear anybody's opinion/ experience about this. (I'm average weight for my height (BMI) and am maintaining my weight)

How this question came to be:

Summary: At the end of June I was starting indoor exercise and my sis knew about it since I just casually told her. I was trying out dieting again with exercise but my schedule at the start of July till now has been so hectic and tiring. I haven't been able to exercise but I'm still maintaining my weight and I decided I'll exercise again when things become a bit organized. (Just in case, I'm just average weight focusing mostly on maintaining it for now)

The arguement happened a bit like this:

It's night and I'm feeling a bit hungry. There's a literal typhoon blowing outside and raining so it reminded me of instant noodles.

Me: I'm going to have instant noodles tomorrow~ 
Sis: (condescendingly) You know, you eat a lot. I've watched you the past few days and you eat a lot. I thought you were on a diet. You had noodles a few days ago.
Me: (I won't lie, I was a bit angry) Do I really have to report to you about my diet? 
Sis: (complains I used the word ""report"") You should have said you aren't on a diet anymore! and the fight goes on about why I should have told her I'm not on diet and that my credibility will go down if I do stuff like that(meaning not telling people you aren't doing said thing anymore). 
She also told me that she wishes for me to be in this exact same situation in the future with somebody else, so that I know that she's right.

I'm in literal confusion and stress at her going off on me. I don't feel it's my duty to tell anybody all my dieting thoughts unless I personally asked somebody to help me keep track of myself? I've never asked her to help me through my diet nor did I ever want her to. I feel it's my own responsibility to do or not do whatever I want since the consequences will be my own to deal with.

Any opinion would be helpful right now or even any personal experiences with this kind of situation would be helpful too. I'm in utter confusion as to why she was so infuriated too.

441,Help with calories and macros,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone this is my first post here, I've been lurking for a few months now... I've finally decided to start my weight loss journey. I've been yoyo dieting my entire life... 12 years ago I lost 100+ pounds, and kept it off for about 6 years , then I slowly gained it all back like 25 pounds a year...

Well I've reached that point now I've been avoiding pictures, mirrors, and anything socially because I am embarrassed. I have an entire closet of clothes that don't fit, and I hate it.

How I had lost it was a doctor monitored fasting program with a lot of exercise. I had kept up the exercise and ate as correctly as I possibly knew, but then it all fell apart.

Well I decided to finally do something about it. I am fed up, obese and depressed.

I've been successfully eating about 1200 calories a day, drinking only water. ( One coffee with a cup of half and half in the morning)

I've started walking 30 mins a night, until I can ride my mountain bike again without dying. I will be joining a gym to start weightlifting again as well within the next two weeks.

I've been logging my nutrition on myfitness pal...

Are my Macros good? Do I need to eat more?

Advice is greatly appreciated. I've been eating a local meal delivery service that offers 21 meals for a week for 99 dollars. It helps me as I have limited time to prep.

[https://imgur.com/GQ2VAPc](https://imgur.com/GQ2VAPc)

For example this is breakfast 270 calories, 6grams of fat, 30 carbs and 24g of protein.

All of the meals are 300-500 calories. Very low in saturated fat, high in protein, and around 30grams of carbs.

Thanks for all the advice and help.

451,"What nutritional value would the optimal snack have? (protein, oils, soluble fibre, etc)","So, I know everyone's digestion is different, and there'll be no combination of nutrition that would work for everyone, but broad-brush, what would roughly be the ideal snack? I'm thinking if we could make something from scratch in a lab.

&amp;#x200B;

I read online that too much:

* protein can lead to indigestion, nausea, liver and kidney injuries, cardiovascular problems
* soluble fibre can lead to constipation unless you drink enough water
* insoluble fibre can lead to diarrhoea
* sugars and carbs can lead to obesity, diabetes, etc
* oils and fats leads to indigestion and high calorie intake
* sufficient trace quantities of any vitamins, minerals, omegas, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My guess is that if something was around the following it would be about optimal:

* 40% protein
* 3% oil/fat 
* 32% soluble fibre
* 20% insoluble fibre
* 5% carb/sugar

454,I think I eat about 3500 - 4000 calories per day. Is it bad for weight loss?,"I had a thread in /r/solotravel talking about how expensive eating out when travelling is, however people think that I'm eating an insane unhealthy amount of food.

For example, my typical meal consists of following:

- 200 g of pasta (up to 250 g after doing intense exercise)
- 150 to 200 g of chicken / beef meat
- about 150 g of vegetable
cooked without adding any sauce, which is around 1300 - 1400 calories per meal.

Alternatively, I may eat up to 36 pieces of sushi which is also similar amount of calories as well, and sometimes if I want to treat myself well (especially after a sport race), I will have a 12"" pizza all by myself which is roughly 1900 calories.

I commonly have 2.5 - 3 such meals a day, which is about 3500 - 4000 calories a day. I tried to keep myself at 2 meals per day, skipping dinner and only having breakfast and lunch, but I got too hungry and too tired easily after morning swim squad training and added a second breakfast between my first breakfast and my late lunch.

I'm M26, 174 cm tall and, a few years ago when I graduated from university I was only 62 kg, but after a year of little exercise my weight increased to 73 kg with serious deterioration in running performance, and now my weight is still at 67 kg with marathon-level swim training which has no longer dropped in the past few months.

I want to reduce my weight to reduce my pain in running, while keeping my marathon level swim training (in cold water under channel rules) as well. Ideally I want to go back to 62 kg where I was a few years ago, but is it possible if I still eat so much (especially in winter, as swimming in cold water increases appetite by 44%) ?

474,Getting Frustrated,"Been trying out a bunch of diets, each has led to stomach upset and a mixture of diarrhea and constipation.

So i've been on a modified version of the BRAT diet. I avoid all things which cause me stomach pain and digestive troubles (mainly uncooked greens, almost any fruit, and any beans). I mostly eat potato, rice, eggs, chicken, yogurt. Sometimes I eat oatmeal, cooked spinach, bagels with sunflower seed spread.   

At first I felt clean and clear, pain free, and for the first month I was eliminating every other day or even every day. 
The fourth came and suddenly I was having the same problem I was having before: gas, pain, green mushy poo with blood and mucus in it. To be fair I did have fruit pie, but I usually don't have negative reactions to cooked fruit.  Also it is taking me three-four days to go to the bathroom instead of once every other day like before. 

Possible Causes:

483,What if all the diet advice you have listened to is wrong? Gary Taubes thinks so,"Seventeen years ago, in July of 2002, Gary Taubes broke what I thought was to be the biggest story of our time. All the advice we've been spoon-fed about counting calories, eating low fat, avoiding salt, all of it, was not based on any scientifically proven hypothesis. The dietary advice handed down from the food guidelines established by the US government, implemented in school lunch programs, hospitals, military and so forth was all based on a few white men from the East Coast’s theories. That right, none of it was tested in clinical trials and found to be true.

There is evidence that the Germans in pre-WWII had an understanding of how hormonal regulation influences our ability to fatten up or slim down, but that research was thrown out when we won the war and those men in charge of studying nutrition decided instead to cherry-pick data points that confirmed their preconceived predilections.

Now, we’re a nation of fat sick people.

We produce a show called Empowered Health, a podcast focused on navigating women's health, we just released an episode about this research and history with the expert on the subject, Gary Taubes. Figured this subreddit may be interested in the episode. For those who don't know, he’s the author of Good Calories, Bad Calories; Why We Get Fat, The Case Against Sugar and others. Taubes is an investigative journalist who painstaking went through all the research and all the footnotes in all the research to determine what was valid advice and what’s garbage.

His reporting is compelling and I was sure he was about to change the world. But, he didn’t. Yes, the needle was nudged, but the scandal has hardly had the influence I would have expected given the massive impact it has on our lives.

“Nobody's trying to deceive you because they know the truth,” Taubes said. “They're trying to deceive you because they've already fooled themselves.”

485,Have you heard of the milk diet? No you probably havent but youd better listen in.,"I made a realization today, everyones saying Ive lost a lot of weight recently and i cant figure out why I havent been on any diets or exercising more then usual. A friend recently commented about how i drink a lot of milk. Today i went to drink my sixth cup of whole milk today and after drinking it in two sips, Thats when it clicked in my mind! 

For the past two years i would often drink a glass or two of milk when i was hungry because all my food is dull. But then i wouldnt be hungry for when the next meal rolled around.

This caused me to cosume around 1/3 less food then usual. 

The downsides of this diet you may ask?
The only real downside is im now addicted to milk but that isnt really a bad thing cause it keeps me on the diet.

I may be a genius, yes, but I am not a doctor, buddy!

487,Is there a way to reward myself after cutting back on sugar ?,"I know that once you cut away sugar from your diet(added and processed sugars) like sugar drinks (replace with water) and candy (stop with candy and snacks) your body will for a period of time get cravings for sugar (a big part of my diet and good part of the calories I consume). To compensate for those cravings i will have to set up a reward system for my brain to follow. The human brain loves rewards, that will make it easier to motivate following the diet and maybe later when I find time start to exercise.

505,Need help starting an eating plan,"This is for my husband. He eats like a child, grilled cheese, pizza, hot dogs with ketchup and american cheese, pancakes and donuts, popped corn, etc. 

He also has no upper teeth and cannot wear a denture.

Recently we found out he is back in the prediabetic range with his A1C, and his triglycerides are way too high. Doc had given him 3 months to get his diet in order or he has to back on meds.

Previously he was prediabetic and went on metformin. He also went from drinking nothing but Coke, to drinking nothing but Coke Zero. His A1C got better, and after he checked his blood for months at home, he decided to go off the metformin.

When he went off the metformin, he started eating in an intermittent fasting way, and lost about 20 lbs.

He wants to start eating healthy, but has no idea where to start. Food tastes different for him due to an accident when he was a child, he's missing a good percentage of his taste buds. Also he has no tolerance for spices. Even cinnamon will upset his intestines if he eats too much.

His motivators are lowering his triglycerides and A1C, branching out in terms of what he eats, and finding one meal that he can eat everyday, and what he can snack on, with no teeth. 

He doesn't care what the diet is. He currently does not like a bunch of foods, but also cannot eat a lot of foods. His teeth situation is a big problem. He has bottoms, but no uppers. When he eats tougher things like crusty bread, veggies or meat, he hurts his gums and tires himself out before hes satiated.

He wants to gain muscle and lose fat. He thinks if he can master one meal, he can break his addiction to all those carby foods he currently eats.

He is desperate, and he asked me to post this so some kind redditors might know what he is going through and can help.

509,Very low calorie diet but just because I’m eating low calorie things,"I’m trying to lose a bit of weight, like everybody I suppose, and I’m trying to figure out if what I’m doing is healthy or not. 
So I’m eating breakfast, lunch and dinner still, I’m not starving myself, but my breakfast, lunch and dinner is generally a cuppa soup sachet and some full cream milk mixed in to make it a little creamier. If I’m still hungry after that I’ll have another soup.
When I do this my calorie intake for a day is usually under 1000, but I’m not starving because I’ve still been feeding myself, just what I’m eating has a low calorie content.
I’ve read that if your body has such a low calorie intake, it goes into starvation mode and starts storing fat. I guess what I’m confused about is if I’m having low calories in a day but I am not starving myself, I feel well fed, does my body still go into “starvation mode”?

510,Trying to gain muscle mass and tone down a tad.,"So I just recently started at a warehouse gym. The great and hardworking atmosphere has beckoned me to start eating correctly. This is my daily routine, which I would love to polish. I am 24 years old, 6"" 2' and 200 IBS. 20%ish body fat.

&amp;#x200B;

MEAL: Wake and eat two packets of oatmeal. 

Grab coffee with vanilla almond creamer and go to work.

SNACK: All day I drink coffee and water and on the side of my desk I have a glass jar full of opened pistachios, with sunflower seeds, and dried fruits and nuts put in with a few white and dark chocolate chips. I eat this throughout the day.

LUNCH: sandwich with chicken slices, cheddar cheese and chipotle mayo with 5 grain bread. I will once or twice a week hit up Chipotle and get a bowl of chicken, white rice, veggies, cheese, hot sauce, lettuce and loaded with Tabasco. Sweet tea

Get off work at 5, go to gym that is similar to metro-flex in Arlington, TX. Drink a 3/4 scoop of JYM pre-workout and lift for an hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

LIFTING: Athlean-X is one of my motivators, but I dont feel myself getting more massive in my arms. **I have always had a struggle getting bigger arms**. Ill workout two sets of muscles at a time that correlate with each other in some way. (back and triceps, chest and biceps, etc.) I always start on stair stepper going fast for 3-5 minutes or slower with weights.

Leave gym, drink one scoop of Gold standard whey.

DINNER: kale, bell peppers, onions, chicken sausage in four eggs scramble with three flour tortillas to eat. Me and my roommates are also massive consumers of hummus and chips.

When sugar cravings come, I get a scoop of Justins hazelnut butter. Its rich, but heavy and calms my craving down drastically. 

SLEEP: Avg night is 7-5 hours

&amp;#x200B;

Im trying to become more toned and build muscle. Is this a good routine? Should I cut something out and add something on? Anything helps.

511,What is going wrong? (Be prepared for a HUGE text lmao),"Hi all, I’m new to this community so pardon me if I forget anything important. I’m a 22 years-old male, 185cms weighing 86kg at the moment. I started at 92kg in February, honestly I find 6kgs in 4-5months quite slow and would like to know what you guys think about that weight loss rate. I did have 2 weeks where i didnt go to the gym due to exams but still tracked my macros, I think that might have had a role but still I believe its quite slow.

Other than that, this whole month I have been crushing the gym and my nutrition in my opinion. I do resistance training at least 4 days a week and I track my progressive overload with Excel to be sure I’m making progress. Since 2 weeks I have also upped my cardio, so I had cardio 3-4days a week (mostly after my resistance training) where i burned 250-400kcals per cardio session. Outside of my workouts and cardio, I have walked 9-10kms during my days over the last 2 weeks as well, which is 250kcals according to MyFitnessPal

On nutrition, I try to keep my daily caloric intake around 1600kcals. Although I’ve been doing this, I’m still going between 86,5 and 85,9kgs when i weigh myself. I tried to find out why this happens and the two most commonly written things are ‘starvation mode’ (which I have never believed and I don’t think I’ll ever believe) and that I don’t track accurately. I have no doubt about how I track because I’ve tracked my macros for a long time and actually I even weigh everything of which I don’t know the weight to be sure I track correctly. 

After all I notice I’ve written a shitload of text😅 I’m wondering if anybody here can explain me why it is that I dont see any weightloss even though I’m doing it this way, and maybe help me to correct my mistakes. If you have read all the way, it’s truly appreciated.

513,I’m feeling guilty after my (healthy and normal sized) meals. Any advice?,"(Sorry for mistakes, nonnative here)Little background: recently, after many years of bad eating habits, I made changes in my life. I feel like I can stick with this way of eating for a long time, because I did not changed overnight, at first I just measured everything I ate, even pizza and chips. I use the app ‘yazio’, I calculated my BMR (~1700 kcal) but I can’t eat/afraid to eat that amount. 
I switched to healthier food, and I have waaaay more vegetable than before. So I’m always full after eating. My problem is: I feel super guilty after eating my food. I finished my salad (chicken, cucumber, lettuce, light mozzarella, low fat yogurt, sugarfree ketchup, wholegrain tortilla wrap, ~440 kcal) an hour ago, I’m full now and I feel terrible. Which is weird, because with my old habits, I rarely had this feeling, but I ate so much more and bad things. I basically lived on potato, pasta and cheese, and ate a whole pizza several times a week, as well as at least 2 big bags of chips. I’m really concerned about this, because I finally see myself stick to this healthier way but it’s scary. I don’t want to develop an eating disorder. 
So did anyone feel this way before? What can I do to achieve my goals (losing at least 50 lbs- I’m currently 194 lbs being 5’ 5” and 21F) and stay mentally healthy at the same time?

515,"How Do You Do 1,200 Calories a Day if You're Busy?","To be 100% honest, I *rarely* cook food for myself. My primary reason why is lack of time. I can give myself *just* enough time to treadmill for half an hour and *sometimes* take my dog on a half-hour walk, but any more time than that stresses me out. (Even an extra ten minutes to do an ab routine. Trust me, I tried that, and the emotional stress of not having full time to relax after work ((because working out is *not* relaxing to me -- I'm jealous of those of you who do find it relaxing)) was awful.) So cooking food isn't top on my priority list.

Which sucks because eating just 90 calorie oranges for breakfast, a 60 calorie microwaveable soup for lunch, and a frozen 280 calorie meal for dinner sucks. Yeah, that gives me a lot of wiggle room for snacks and stuff, but I usually can't have snacks because then I just crave more and more and more until I screw myself over (yeah, snacks meaning veggies and fruits, too). I understand that all of this means I just need more filling things for meals, but then my busyness comes back into play and I can't find the time to prep meals or make them after work.

In the 1940s, the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) was created to provide serving standards as a goal for proper nutrition. The publication of the RDA was periodically revised to meet the new scientific knowledge and interpretations of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

The framework for the RDA comes from a variety of factors:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Studies of subjects maintained on diets containing low or deficient levels of nutrients, followed by correction of the deficit with measured amounts of the nutrient.
2. Nutrient balance studies that measure nutrient status about intake.
3. Biochemical measurements of tissue saturation or adequacy of molecular function with nutrient intake.
4. Nutrient intakes of fully breastfed infants and allegedly healthy people from their food supply.
5. Epidemiological observations of nutrient status in populations with intake.
6. In some cases, an extrapolation of data from animal experiments.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the 1960s, the public had little information on food labels to help identify the nutritional content of processed food purchased. However, the 1970s saw an increase in processed foods. With more information coming to light linking diet and food, consumers started to demand more information from the processed foods they purchased. However, there was very little, and so many manufacturers were left to guess. Still, what they found was consumers preferred to buy products labeled with nutrition information. Therefore most chose to utilize the Nutrition Facts label. With no standardization and no information from the FDA, most resorted to a basic nutritional label.

&amp;#x200B;

In the 1980s, the government provided more guidelines for food processors, but the information presented to consumers only showed a percentage of the recommendations by the U.S. RDA. The data was available to the general public, but they had to write a letter to the FDA to obtain it, and most didn't do this.

In the early 1990s, the Food and Drug Administration created the standard Nutrition Fact Label we know today. It was based, at the time, on what the FDA considered a healthy daily intake of 2,000 calories. Here's a sample label from 1990:

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.menutail.com/96dfe8d45b8fbe13ad7c29f53230e4efe8f3f81c9511.original.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.menutail.com/96dfe8d45b8fbe13ad7c29f53230e4efe8f3f81c9511.original.png)

&amp;#x200B;

What was the world like in the 1990s?

&amp;#x200B;

\- For the first half of the decade, The Internet existed as a novelty that only a handful of people had access to it.

\- Released in in 1995, Windows 95 made the Internet more accessible to people, but it would take 3-4 years before people finally joined the Internet Age.

\- Windows 3.11 came out in 1992, and it was possible to go on the world wide web with the Mosiac browser, but this involved installing a socket called Winsock. The most popular of these at the time was called Trumpet.

\- Computers in the early 90s ran MS-DOS or Mac System 7; later Windows 95 and Mac OS 8.

\- For most of the 1990s the world was not connected to the Internet.

\- For most of the 1990s, people had to go places more often to see the world.

\- For most of the 1990s, people had to go places more often to be with their friends.

\- For most of the 1990s, people were more active outdoors.

&amp;#x200B;

What type of jobs existed in the 1990s?

&amp;#x200B;

""Manufacturing and construction jobs dominated the public sector. However, labor jobs started to decline by about 33% since 1990. Meanwhile, employment in knowledge-intensive and service-oriented areas, such as education, health, and professional and business services, has approximately doubled.""

[https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/10/06/1-changes-in-the-american-workplace/](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/10/06/1-changes-in-the-american-workplace/)

&amp;#x200B;

Back then, eating a \~2000 calorie diet was the norm. Most people worked in jobs that burned through a lot of calories like construction, farming, and so forth. Today, most people have sedentary employment.

&amp;#x200B;

How many calories does a typical desk job burn in a day?

&amp;#x200B;

According to the following, they found that ""a single mouse click should, in theory, burn 1.42 calories.""

[https://gizmodo.com/how-many-calories-does-a-mouse-click-burn-5989869](https://gizmodo.com/how-many-calories-does-a-mouse-click-burn-5989869)

&amp;#x200B;

So in total, your body burns about ""102 calories for each hour you sit at your desk.""

[https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/health/a14587766/how-many-calories-do-you-burn-sitting-at-desk-office-job/](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/health/a14587766/how-many-calories-do-you-burn-sitting-at-desk-office-job/)

&amp;#x200B;

Conversely, according to this site, desk work isn't included in their list of jobs that burn the most calories.

[https://parade.com/253836/linzlowe/which-jobs-burn-the-most-calories-some-of-these-surprised-us/](https://parade.com/253836/linzlowe/which-jobs-burn-the-most-calories-some-of-these-surprised-us/)

&amp;#x200B;

In order of least to most:

Custodial work - Up to 204 calories per hour

Police officer - Up to 204 calories per hour

Masseur, masseuse - 204 calories per hour

Bakery employee - Up to 204 calories per hour

Construction work - 306 calories per hour

P.E. teacher - Up to 374 calories per hour

Farming - Up to 476 calories per hour

Fire fighting - 748 calories per hour

&amp;#x200B;

If most people today work a desk job and eat a 2,000 calorie diet - as the FDA continuously recommends on their Nutrition Facts label - that will lead to obesity without exercise. The FDA needs to tweak the percentages based on two lifestyles: Sedentary and Kinetic. The 2,000 calories are for Kinetic lifestyles, including nursing mothers and anyone who needs that many calories a day. However, for Sedentary people, the %DV should be based on a 1,000 to 1,500 calorie diet.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're thinking, ""Wait! That can't be healthy,"" a lot of research shows there are benefits from a low and very-low-calorie diet.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.webmd.com/diet/low-calorie-diets#1](https://www.webmd.com/diet/low-calorie-diets#1)

""If you have a BMI over 30 (which your doctor will call ""obese""), then a very low-calorie diet may let you lose about 3 to 5 pounds per week, for an average total weight loss of 44 pounds over 12 weeks.""

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21840335](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21840335)

""Restricting the intake of calories has been practiced as a method for increasing both the length and quality of life for over 500 years. Experimental work confirming the success of this approach in animals has accumulated over the last 100 years. *Lifelong caloric restriction (C.R.) may extend life by up to 50% in rodents*, with progressively less impact the later in life it is started. This effect is matched by *profound impacts on age-related diseases including reduced risk of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus*. There are *profound tissue level changes in metabolism* *with a generalized shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism*. . . . C.R. results in reduced oxidative stress and enhanced autophagy, both of which could be essential components of the beneficial effects. There is limited work on non-human primates that shows promising effects and *one randomized controlled trial in humans where physiological markers of the C.R. response are consistent with the responses in mice and rats.*""

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/reducing-daily-calories-is-a-great-way-to-improve-your-quality-of-life/](https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/reducing-daily-calories-is-a-great-way-to-improve-your-quality-of-life/)

""But lowering your risk for these diseases is only part of the potential benefit of cutting calories. Many other benefits of calorie restriction can improve your quality of life and daily functioning. If you're in the normal weight range, this new study also suggests a potential benefit of calorie restriction if done carefully — as long as your BMI doesn't drop below 22.""

&amp;#x200B;

There's also the practice of fasting which is thousands of years old. People have noted health benefits from it. One individual named Paul (known as Joana of the World of Warcraft fame) was born with a condition called Bicuspid Aortic Valve, and he stated after three days of fasting issues he had in his knees went away. He likened the fasting to ""cleaning out all the junk.""

&amp;#x200B;

The bottom line is a 2,000 Calorie diet is for a group of people with very active lifestyles or nursing mothers. Anyone with a Sedentary lifestyle who eats around 2,000 calories a day and doesn't exercise will get obese. Since most people don't exercise, then the next best thing would be to lower caloric intake. Restaurants could help in this regard by offering smaller portion menu items. They could also replace at least one soda flavor with flavored sparkling water. The brand Sparking Ice is terrific and tastes as good as soda.

Noodles. I eat one package a day and now work in a hugely demanding physical job. Im losing weight rapidly but i suspect a lot of that is muscle and such. In 2 weeks i can afford real food again.

Why do i not ever feel hungry anymore? 

Why do i not notice almost any side effects? (No loss of strength, no dizziness or anything at all)

How much of the weight that im losing is fat? (I fit into my old pants again and its a wild feeling lol)

529,The basics of dieting (for beginners),"To lose weight it is quite simple, ""EAT LESS"".  If you are eating in a calorie deficit you are going to lose weight. It does not matter what you are eating as long as your eating less then your maintenance of calories. But then there is the difference, if you want to lose body fat. When you lose weight, you can lose fat, water and to a point muscle. The best thing to do is to try to retain the muscle you have by increasing your protein intake. Protein is a very satiating food (keeps you feeling full), and is arguably the best macronutrient for losing weight. Then carbs and fats come into play.

&amp;#x200B;

Your body requires a certain amount of fats to survive and function, carbohydrates are not required as much. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you wanted to lose weight in the most sustainable way it would look like this in a day

&amp;#x200B;

Roughly 0.8 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. This will retain most of your muscle and keep you full, you don't want to diet down and end up looking like a twig.

&amp;#x200B;

A minimum of around 40g of fats a day, this is required for your body to function.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest you can fill up with carbohydrates or you can go higher in the fats. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just remember if you eat less then maintenance you will lose weight.",0,basics dieting beginners,lose weight quite simple eat less eating calorie deficit going lose weight matter eating long eating less maintenance calories difference want lose body fat lose weight lose fat water point muscle best thing try retain muscle increasing protein intake protein satiating food keeps feeling full arguably best macronutrient losing weight carbs fats come play x200b body requires certain amount fats survive function carbohydrates required much x200b wanted lose weight sustainable way would look like day x200b roughly 0 8 1 gram protein per pound body weight retain muscle keep full want diet end looking like twig x200b minimum around 40g fats day required body function x200b rest fill carbohydrates go higher fats x200b remember eat less maintenance lose weight,basic dieting beginner ,lose weight quite simple eat le eating calorie deficit going lose weight matter eating long eating le maintenance calorie difference want lose body fat lose weight lose fat water point muscle best thing try retain muscle increasing protein intake protein satiating food keep feeling full arguably best macronutrient losing weight carbs fat come play x200b body requires certain amount fat survive function carbohydrate required much x200b wanted lose weight sustainable way would look like day x200b roughly 0 8 1 gram protein per pound body weight retain muscle keep full want diet end looking like twig x200b minimum around 40g fat day required body function x200b rest fill carbohydrate go higher fat x200b remember eat le maintenance lose weight ,basic diet beginn ,lose weight quit simpl eat less eat calori deficit go lose weight matter eat long eat less mainten calori differ want lose bodi fat lose weight lose fat water point muscl best thing tri retain muscl increas protein intak protein satiat food keep feel full arguabl best macronutri lose weight carb fat come play x200b bodi requir certain amount fat surviv function carbohydr requir much x200b want lose weight sustain way would look like day x200b roughli 0 8 1 gram protein per pound bodi weight retain muscl keep full want diet end look like twig x200b minimum around 40g fat day requir bodi function x200b rest fill carbohydr go higher fat x200b rememb eat less mainten lose weight

534,Am I eating too little?,"Okay so I don’t know if I’m eating too little or not.

I’m a teenage male and I’m trying to lose weight (I weigh 142 lbs at 5foot 7inches, and want to be 120-125lbs). So, naturally dieting and exercise is what I should do. But am I going overboard? I have a tendency to do that, here’s some context:

When I was in middle school I also wanted to lose weight. It worked (I went from about 127lbs to 107 if I remember correctly), but I restricted calories and fasted a lot, while never seeing myself as skinny enough. At first I was just trying to eat better using a diet app, but when the diet app said I couldn’t have a daily calorie goal under 800 calories then I just ditched the app and did it myself. I began restricting and fasting. I got heart palpitations (a whole lot, from like standing up), dizziness, and almost passed out a few times. I then got into a fast/binge cycle, I purged a few times. I realized what I was doing was really unhealthy and “got over it”. But the thoughts of restricting and such still linger, basically always there. Sometimes they bother me (I.e. a few weeks ago I was eating out and started freaking out inside because I didn’t want to eat) and sometimes I eat multiple cookies just in spite.

Now I’m trying to lose weight and I feel like I’m falling back into old habits. So far today (it’s now the evening) I’ve eaten about 671 calories. I have ran for 30 minutes and burned 400 cals from that. I’ve started to work out at the gym 3 times a week and usually have about 12+k steps a day (just some general fitness information I guess to tell you what my activity level is).

What should my calorie goal be to lose weight healthily? Thanks and sorry for any typos.

Edit: thanks for the replies, I just wanted to clarify what I mean by dieting. By diet I mean drop junk food and pick up healthier choices.

535,WIP Meal Plan for 21/M/350+ lbs,"Let me start off by saying that I had an almost identical diet for 2 years when I was in middle school where I ended up going from 280 lbs to 200. I went to a gym for an hour everyday for 3 months until some issues happened after winter break. In those 3 months I had lost 30 pounds, if I recall correctly. Over the course of around 2 years, I had lost the other 50 lbs sticking to the same diet. I said this so I don't feel like an idiot if my very basic meal plan sounds stupid. It may be do to the fact that I was still growing and all that, but it was pretty drastic weight loss those first 3 months.  


It's going to be a keto type of diet focusing on low carb intake.

Here is the food I'm going to be purchasing:  
[Cheese Slices](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Deluxe-American-Pasteurized-Process-Cheese-120-count-5-lb/10452405)

[Eggs](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Extra-Large-White-Eggs-18-count-40-5-oz/135825185)

[Turkey Bacon](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Butterball-Lower-Sodium-Turkey-Bacon-12-Oz/15610398)

[Burgers](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-100-Pure-Beef-Patties-8-lb-32-Count/10804578)

[Chicken Breasts](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-All-Natural-Boneless-Skinless-Chicken-Breasts-5-lbs/36179444)

&amp;#x200B;

Breakfast: 2/3 Eggs, 3/4 pieces of bacon, 1/2 cheese slices (not sure how the proportions are, will have to experiment)

Lunch: 2 Burger Patties, 2 slices of cheese

Dinner: 2 Chicken Breasts

Beverage: Water/Club Soda (I will try to stay away from Diet Soda)

&amp;#x200B;

I was considering the possibility of snacking on the cheese slices, but I heard too much dairy is a problem. I know I'm also missing vegetables, but that's something I'll have to get used to before I add it to my diet regularly. I'm planning on trying to incorporate mushrooms/broccoli/lettuce/avacado(?). Since there are no carbs, I'd like to get a decent bit of carbs from veggies, or possibly change my purchases to meat with slightly more carbs.  


For years, I've constantly skipped breakfast, half of the time skipped lunch, and overate whenever I did eat, so I think that limiting the amount of food that I eat to a specific amount everyday will help. Also, in the past, I drank water and Diet Soda (Mostly Diet Mountain Dew, I believe), so drinking only water/club soda should help. I don't know if there's any issues with club soda/sparkling water/La Croix on a diet or the keto diet specifically because I may pick that up. I heard Diet soda can affect your appetite, so I might just stick to water if club soda and the like do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

537,I can’t swallow certain foods,"Ok so I know this sounds kinda weird but every time I try to eat anything leafy or something that takes a while to chew, I can’t swallow it, I’m not sure how to explain it but basically my gag reflex kicks in and eventually I just have to spit it out before I throw up.  Let me give a little backstory, I guess thats what you could call it.  When I was little I had the worst gag reflex and I would throw up everywhere and on everything and eventually it got a little better but not really.   I’ve had this problem all of my life and recently I found out that food that I love to eat and that I can normally eat I just can’t eat anymore and I want to eat it but my body just rejects it, and I know that some people may say like oh just don’t think about it but it’s really hard to not think about it and it’s almost impossible to eat those foods nowadays for me. 




Here’s a list of foods that I struggle to eat: lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, spinach, asparagus, peas, warm carrots, steak, noodles, in some cases rice, anything seafood-y, bananas, tomatoes, steak, applesauce, most of the gummy candies, anything really chewy in general, warm or room temperature water, anything with a really gross texture(oatmeal or anything like it,) any form of egg, some types of cereal, certain types of bread and also there are some foods that make me gag just by looking at them, like cake, donuts, chocolate, and anything that’s really sweet. Also, in the mornings I can’t eat anything until about 4 hours after I wake up (except water) or else I end up throwing up or feeling very nauseous throughout the entire day.

542,Am I doing this right? (Calories In vs Out),"I just want to know if I need to change anything in my routine or add anything to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been doing really well by retraining my eating habits, and going back to the gym. I am F/30 and I started at 200lb. I have been at this since May 28th (so 3 weeks tomorrow). I have a goal of 165 pounds by Oct 1st.  I have lost 6.2 pounds as of today!

I am a big data and numbers type of person and have this all in a spread sheet and tracking everything...

Calories burned: Over the last 20 days I have averaged off of my apple watch 906 active calories burned every day, and 2967 total calories burned threw out the day. I am not sure how accurate that is. But all of my research says the apple watch is the most accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

Exercise: I am averaging 5.5 miles a day between moving around at work and going to the gym.I go to the gym and use the elliptical on a circuit setting for 35-15 mins (about 3miles) and walk about a mile at about 3pmh on a treadmill which takes me about 18-20mins, that is Monday Wed Thurs. On Tuesdays, and Saturdays I walk about 3 miles on the treadmill for 1 hour. I don't go on Friday.  Sunday is a free for all pending on my mood on what I want to do but I do go for 1 hour.   I have a bad shoulder, that is why

&amp;#x200B;

Nutrition: I have cut out extra sugar, soda, and eating out. I drink about 72oz of water day.  I am eating an average of 1516 calories a day while making sure I have a protein every meal.  I do have 2 free eats day but those have not exceeded 1800 calories, those are my Saturday and Tuesday days.

Overview Average: 1516 calories in a day, (906 active calories burned) 2967 Total calories burned = 1451 Calories burned in a day on average.

&amp;#x200B;

I am seeing the results on my scale, and I am feeling it in my clothing.

546,1200 calorie diet for 30-45 days?,"Hi.

I'm wondering if a person could do a 1200 calorie diet for 30-45 days, without too many side-effects, since it's not that long. On this I'm thinking like light/moderate exercise, like say walking 2 hours a day at a medium-to-quick pace, so nothing that would cause the person to need an increasingly large amount of calories.

About me: Male, 140 kg, 5'11/180 cm, 24 years old. Going on a trip soon, which is why I want to try a diet but want to kick-start it with 1000-1400 calories/day for 1-1.5 months (yes Ik Ik it's not viable long run and I'll up it to 1600-1800 after 1.5-2 months max). Just wondering since I'm overweight by quite a lot, would it be feasible to keep to around 1200 calories a day for that amount of time? Or would I just crash? Anyone with experience (or who has general knowledge into the subject) would be nice to hear from.

I know I could google it but I'd like to hear inputs from people on it instead of just ""first google result, click here"" or use a calculator because it's different to experience something and see it unfold on paper/in theory :/

Anyway, have a nice day folks and take care :D

549,When I eat more than 1000 calories in a day I gain weight uncontrollably. Help!,"Two years ago I weighed over 350lbs.

I currently weigh around 220lbs.

I am 6'2"" tall male, for reference.

When I was 350lbs, I would estimate that I ate a full dinner's worth of food at every meal and snack. This is how I was raised, and I was met with incredible resistance from my family once I cut my food intake to 1500 calories per day *(omg are you getting anorexic on me?)*

I found that I plateaued out at around 270lbs eating this way, and once again cut my food intake down to 1000 calories, at least until I achieved my target weight of 175lbs.

I have plateaued at my current weight. I ate 1500 calories daily for a week, and found that I gained three pounds. I then tried eating 2000 calories daily for another week, and I gained another *five pounds.* It took me about a month back at 1000 calories to get rid of those extra pounds of fat I put on, and I've once again plateaued at 220.

Does a human with incredibly low muscle mass really need to eat 2000 calories? I'm starting to question that... I know one pound of muscle takes up \~500 calories each day just to stay alive, so am I to assume that because I'm an endomorph whos managed to shrink himself almost to the point of healthiness that I need to eat less than the average person? Why is this happening to me, I just want to look like an average person for once in my life instead of being a landwhale.

I'm not even sedentary anymore, after wrecking my car buried me in debt and made me break the bicycle out. I eventually pushed myself to ride 20 miles to see my friend; after the first ride I thought my legs would go into rhabdomyalysis; after a few of them, I feel like my legs have a nearly limitless supply of energy to work with.

550,Weight gain anywhere above 1800kcal/day,"Hello all,

Very similar to another post recently made... But I wanted to post my particular problem.

So I've[27M] been using MyFitnessPal for about 3 years, I limited myself to 1800kcal/day and I lost ~70-75lbs over the following year. Basically within 10lbs of my goal and almost having a 6 pack... I started at ~235lbs

But then things got bad... Out of nowhere I basically start gaining weight and I'm now about 35 lbs heavier then my lowest and I have not changed my diet at all, I weigh everything and I cook almost all of my food myself.

At this point I'm going to the gym for 2 hours a day, lifting with 30 min of cardio. And am limiting myself to 1500-1800kcal/day and I'm still gaining weight slowly. My gut is growing so it's not muscle and I'm feeling at a loss and guys at the gym are recommending trying something like the ACA stack to try to boost things again...

Edit: at this point it's negatively effecting almost everything in my life from work, to socializing and even hobbies because I'm desperately tired all the time, I've gotten to the point I rarely actually feel hungry though.

I have struggled with a restrictive food intake eating disorder in the past. But I’m in a better place mentally after seeking treatment. The thing is, eating more often isn’t actually helping me gain weight. I need to change what food I’m eating. I am a very boring eater because I don’t LOVE food the way other people do. I have a weird relationship with food. I love to work out, which might be part of the problem. I’ve completely stopped running until I feel as though I’m at a healthy weight because I don’t want it to contribute to weight loss (but this is killing me as I love to run). I continue to do yoga and muscle-building exercises (but I know I’m not going to build muscle if I don’t eat enough to get me out of being underweight). So any tips and tricks on gaining weight would be greatly appreciated. Also if there is a more appropriate subreddit for this, let me know!

I have been trying to lose weight lately to feel better about my own body but no diets plan are working for me so far so I am wondering if there's any advice / recommendation I can get from you guys.

My BMI is completely normal, but I feel a little chubby here and there, especially around my thighs and stomach area, so I am hoping to lose some weight to look better for myself when I look in the mirror. I'm 20 y/o, was a professional athlete, so I used to have big muscles around my thighs, shoulders and arms.

I workout every day and keep my calories intake around 1000kcal per day (I am not a big eater) but no progress has shown on the scale or mirror in the past months. So I am wondering if there is any diet plan / fasting plan or any routine at all that you personally tried/have been trying works for you? And can I mix different diet plans in different weeks, or do I have to stick to just one for a while? I am looking for any plans and routine that are healthy and efficient.

585,Why can't I stop obsessing over my weight,"I am a 20F and in the past few years I have had a terrible relationship with food. I went through a long period of time where I would starve myself consecutively, and within a year or so I dropped about 10-15 pounds. Up until the past month or two, would weigh myself at least 3 times a day, and basically have a panic attack every time the scale fluctuated in a way I didn't want it to. Ever since I lost the weight, I have been terrified of gaining it back. Even though I know it's not healthy, and I have been taking steps towards eating more and not weighing myself as often, the paranoia will not go away.

&amp;#x200B;

 It's been about two months since I have stepped on a scale, and I recently traveled across the world for the summer, and I have tried many different kinds of foods and eaten a lot more than I would normally feel comfortable doing.

586,I’m on a diet and dreaming of junk food,"Since the start of my high protein, no sugar diet all I’ve done is fantasize about junk food. I had graphic dreams of donuts and cupcakes. I want pancakes and sausage and a s’mores Frappuccino and a bagel. Sometimes I dreams of toast with butter and jam.  And a Hershey bar. 

I feel guilty cause my diet has been successful but I can’t stop my mind from wandering to all the delicious sugar treats that I miss. I’ve already decided to have a donut themed birthday party in the fall since I should be at my goal weight by then.

595,Want to share a interesting oat-based diet starter to increase insulin sensitivity and reduce cravings.,"Hi, 

i learned about a diet starter on German public TV. And i thought it's worth sharing, as i didn't hear about this in English media. Its based on the idea of getting rid of sugar addiction before actually starting a diet. Sugar addiction is what most people call ""Cravings"". Its an actual addiction that makes you want to eat. Its based on the simple fact that you can get addicted to the sugar-high after eating/drinking specific carbohydrates and sugar. You can read more about that [here](https://www.sweetdefeat.com/blog/sugar-addiction). 

The following sources are german.

This diet-starter combines this with [the knowledge](https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2006-943783) that simple Oat-flakes are able to improve your insulin sensitivity if taken in correctly. Similar diets are used in treating Diabetes Mellitus since more then a hundred years and were developed by Carl von Noorden, a German pathologist who opened the first clinic with a focus on treating diabetes. I have heard from this diet for the first time in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCyYTr8sf1c). It's from German public TV(=free of ads and state-funded) and done with the help of doctors and nutrition exports. 

So the promise of this diet-starter is: it increases insulin sensitivity, which is important for Type 2 diabetics, by eating primarily oat-flakes over the course of three days. And it should help to end your cravings. And my experience is: it works extremely well. Getting through this 3 days was not as hard as i thought. And after this 3 days i had no cravings left at all. Quite the opposite. I just didn't want to eat much any more. Eating too much - especially fat stuff - made me feel physically unwell. So i reduced my portion size because i felt *full*, not because i thought i should stop eating. Very different from any other diet, that often leaves you hungry and starving. It gave me a real chance to change my eating behaviour. And it was also extremely cheap. 

Blood sugar also looked very good after those 3 days. I'm not a diabetic, but my doctor said in my yearly check-up that my levels are getting higher and closer to the point where I'd need medication. 

I recommend doing this in your holidays, as it's pretty hard to do this during work-days. 

I started with buying ingredients. 

For the low-fat broth(alternative bouillion but be aware: boring taste makes every diet harder) i needed: 

- 500g-750g chicken pieces with bones(skin and fat removed) 
- 2 carrots, 
- 1 leek, 
- a small celery, 
- I also add the bad parts from the other veggies. The hard part of the broccoli. The upper part of garlic(looks like leek), the hard part of the fennel. You get the idea.

For the oat-flake ""stews"": 

- 1 kilo of oat flakes(the thin, flaky ones). 
- 500g meat. lean beef, chicken breast, prawns, scallops, squid. Whatever you like.
- a big load of fresh parsley,
- 2 lemons with edible skin, 
- fresh garlic,
- 2 zucchini,
- 1 broccoli,
- mushrooms,
- fennel
- and other sugar free veggies you like. 
- Also: a small junk of butter. The higher the quality, the better the taste. I use fresh sour-cream-based butter from happy cows with a distinctive cows-ass+grass flavour. 

I start with a broth. I remove all visible fat and skin from those chicken pieces. I add all the bones with all carrot, leek, celery, a bit of garlic and thyme into a large pot and fill it with water. I cook it - after it boiled once - on low heat for around 3 hours to make a nice, fat free broth. Tip: Put in salt at the end. The broth will taste richer. 

I also prepare the lemon ""Moroccan""-style. You can ignore this step if you hate lemon. Cut it into rough slices, put them into a zip bag add in 2-3 tablespoons of salt. Then mix it well and put it into the fridge at least 3 hours before you use it. Yes, its a lot of salt. It will suck out the bitterness, soften it up and concentrate the lemon flavour. I use this for seasoning as it goes very well with the butter/oatflakes/chicken-mix. 

The daily meals consist out of 3 portions. For each portion you are allowed to add 100-150g veggies/herbs/garlic, around 50g chicken meat and a half teaspoon of butter. A very small piece. **Note:** the original diet is without any meat. I add lean, fat free chicken/beef/prawns, because it tastes a lot better and because i think a bit of protein is necessary for a balanced diet. For each day you need 250g oat flakes. I split the flakes up into one main course with 100g and two 75g courses. Eat the big portion at the time you normally eat the most.

**A example preparation is:** chop up ~150g of veggies like zucchini, fennel, 2 mushrooms, garlic and/or broccoli. Also 2-3 lemon slices from the prepared lemon(finely chopped) and some parsley. Cut around half a breast or a half leg into small pieces. Use a small pot, put in butter, add in the chopped veggies and roast them on not too high heat until they get a bit of colour. Then add in around 200ml of broth and some thyme and let it cook until your veggies are how you like them and then add the meat and the lemon. When it cooks again and the meat is done: add the oat flakes. They are done almost instantly. Add in some more broth if needed. Give it a nice stir and take it from the heat. Check if you need salt, also add some pepper. Enjoy your meal. 

You can vary the meat with lean beef, prawns, scallops, squid and other lean meat. However you vary the dish: don't add sugar, cream or milk, and never any fat beside the small piece of butter. 

After this 3 days you can start with any diet you want. I prefer counting calories(~1500kcal). It works pretty great for me. If you are a diabetic it's recommended to add one or two of these oat-flake-days per week to improve your insulin sensitivity.

A nice general tip for diet: Try to eat with chop sticks or the wrong hand(left hand if you are right handed. This makes you eat slower and feeling full earlier.

596,Do I need a diet break? Am I pushing too hard,"6’ 175 pounds (started from 197)  
24 year old Male
Cutting since 12 weeks (no break)
Started with  0 cardio and 2,500 ish Cals per day

Macros: 2,000 calories ~
Carbs: 150g 
Fat: 73g 
Protein: 183g 
Cardio: 2x a day (burning 700 cals total) 
Workout: 7x a week (2 days are just abs) 
Cheat meal: 1x a  week 
Sleep: 8-9 hours  

I pretty much have a sedentary lifestyle. Just got done with school so sitting around all day (no job + no stress). Strength is the same and I feel recovered before each gym session. Cut seems to be going good, but starting to feel sluggish and unmotivated. However, not hungry. Could I be pushing too hard or am I low on vitamins / minerals?  

I’m trying to get below 170 to get a full six pack. Right now can see the outlines. Should I keep going or reduce the cardio? Should I take a diet break to reset hormones / metabolism.

I know this is not the way to lose fat in any means.

But, what if I stopped eating completely for 4 out 7 days a week?

My meal plan is 2400kcal a day.
My BMR is ~2000kcal a day. 
My active burn is anywhere from 1000-1500 kcal.

614,Diet for the Gods,"This diet took 5 years and over 1,000 hours of research to find out what the optimal diet looked like for goals of longevity, muscle building, libido, skin health/appearance, and energy. Every ingredient has a purpose and efficacy with the exception of the last one that has great promise in animal studies. If you can give up taste and treat food as utility you will see yourself improve to insane levels. This has everything the body needs and some. Eat this everyday for a year and you will not recognize yourself both in internal feeling and exterior appearance. This diet is the strictest of strict, you are only allowed one cheat meal a week for an A grade (A+ for no cheating). It is also strict on time, involving and intermittent fasting schedule of an 8 hour feeding window followed by a 16 hour fast and should be incorporated with a 4-5 day a week weight training routine. Proportions are based on weight and goals, you can use myfitnesspal and an online weight gain/loss calculator to customize the diet for yourself. Also, quiting smoking cigs and drinking alcohol are also recommended with micro doses of Gabby (once a week), Molly, (once a month w/ 1 Kiwi Fruit), Lucy (once a quarter), and Kelly (once a year) as replacements if needed. You can vape Mary everyday. It may seem daunting, but you'll find its easy after two weeks and discover the convenience of little to no prep time. This diet is around 3,486 calories, with 150g of protein.

638,"Sugar, wheat and milk are overrated food items that can actually make you sick (I'm pretty sure this post is relevant to this subreddit.)"," A few months ago, my sister in law suggested to me and my mother to try out a diet/lifestyle program called Wildfit. At first, my mother and I were skeptical but my mother decided to try it anyway. When my mother became slimmer as a result of the program, I decided to take part in it myself. The fact that my blood test results improved after eating the same kinds of food that she ate while she followed the 90-day long Wildfit program was another reason why I decided to follow it myself. Among the things that I had to cut out while following the program were refined sugar, wheat products and milk products.

As I followed the program, I realized the full extent of the negative effects that come from eating excess carbohydrates, refined sugar being the worst of all. I can say with the certainty of personal experience, and losing 10kg of weight, that refined sugar is a major contributor of obesity and is in fact even worse than fat. Sadly, a lot of commercial food products have sugar added and it is no exaggeration to say that refined sugar consumption is a serious personal healthcare issue. After all, it is a well-known fact that excess consumption of sugar causes diabetes and obesity.

Wheat is also another source of carbohydrates and is one of the ""empty carbs"" food items which can make you fat. While it may not be not as obesity-inducing as refined sugar, it can cause excess mucus production. I should know because I started coughing out mucus when I had some bread after following the Wildfit program. No matter how nice bread tastes, I cannot ignore the fact that it will make me cough out mucus.

Milk mostly comes from industrialised farming of cows and anyone who knows about industrialised farming would know that the living conditions of ""industrialised livestock"" is horrendous. Milk that comes from industrialised farming of cows is more likely than not contaminated with nasty stuff such as pus and excess antibiotics. Also, while most people can tolerate the lactose in milk and milk products such as cheese, milk is actually an optional food item at best. Think about it, early human societies that did not raise animal livestock lived fine without milk so we should be capable of doing the same. Don't get me wrong, I like cheese but eating a cheese tart made me suffer a gastric reflux after following the Wildfit program.

In conclusion, refined sugar, wheat products and dairy products are overrated food items and ingredients and we are actually better off avoiding them to stay healthy. Instead, take more vegetables, lean meat and water. Fruits and starchy root vegetables such as cassava are also fine but in moderation since they are rich in carbohydrates.",0,sugar wheat milk overrated food items actually make sick pretty sure post

639,Plateauing Hard. Help!,"Hey there, great Redditors. I'm a male, 5'7"", 25 years old. In April 2018, I stepped on the scale and realized I had to make a change. My weight was 310 lbs. I hated how I felt. I hated putting my shoes on in the morning. I hated being out of breath. It was just bad. I have very little time to exercise, so I started to change my food habits. I went with a caloric deficit at first and lost a good amount of weight on that. Later on, I discovered intermittent fasting, and starting doing that, which also helped. I also switched to a ""keto-ish"" diet (low carb, medium fat, medium protein). By far, that was the most successful and I lost a lot of weight on it. In December 2018, I was 258 lbs, a great success. Still far from my 190 lbs goal, but significantly closer than where I started.

Due to some work travel issues and such, it became hard for me to keep up with my routine. I fell off the wagon for some time, which put me at 270 in Feb 2019. Since Feb, I've been back on the style that worked best for me: OMAD IF, Ketoish diet, and a large caloric deficit. Since Feb, I've been hovering around the 263 mark, never breaking 260. 

This is super discouraging to me. Do you have any advice? What would help? I don't want to stop, but I'm not seeing the results to encourage me to keep pushing.

I’m very susceptible to mood swings while hungry and this plays a role in my poor attitude. 

I didn’t lose weight in the best way the first time but I lost a lot and fast. Working out made me less aware of hunger and what I was doing. 

Now as an adult with a desk job, I have realized my unhealthy relationship with food and become hyper aware of everything. 

I only eat nutritious foods and deserts are only homemade with the least amount of sugar possible. I don’t eat table sugar, soda, sweetened flavorings, bread, grains, rice, milk, or cheese. 

But alas, I’ve sat stagnant. 

I think I’ve given myself too much variety and made things harder to stick to. I think I need to go back to 3 meals at set times of the same foods every day.

641,Suddenly felt light headed while sitting down. Blood pressure dropped. Is this normal? My diet has changed,"I have a concern/question.I've been on this new habit where I don't eat until I feel completely empty. I actually really like the feeling of not having any food in my stomach.

Today I had a rough day at work in the morning trying to get my stupid code to work. It upset me and I was so frustrated. More than usual. I got through it though and felt alright. At the end of the day I suddenly felt very light headed. I was simply sitting in my chair. It felt like the blood pressure from my head instantly dropped. I've been so loopy and tired. I couldn't talk straight and the best word to describe me was""loopy""I'm writing this post right now in my loopy state so sorry if it reads weird.

660,Do nutrition shakes and the like actually work?,"I have a sever eating disorder and self sabotaging tenancies. I lost six pounds, put on ten. If I try to eat healthy I go straight for junk food in a panic. I also have such high anxiety that a lot of things make me sick. Milk, eggs, cheese, grease, salad, even carrots can set me off. (Mostly dairy and grease. Salad doesn't digest well. I think it's too starchy?). I also just don't have the motivation to cook due to depression. I pretty much live on sugar. Yesterday all I ate was two cinnamon bagels, four ice cream sandwiches, and three pieces of cake. 

Clearly I need to get my eating under control, and clearly I have a serious uphill battle ahead of me. But the lack of nutrition is starting to heavily wear on me. I have no energy and just FEEL wrong. So I need to do SOMETHING. If I get healthy snacks I know I'll eat them all in one day. That's pretty much left me with nutrition shakes or vitamins to pretty much support my diet until I can get the depression under control. (Depression cure = get moving Unable to get moving due to lack of nutrition. Unable to make nutritional foods due to depression. Lack of nutrition makes depression worse, etc) 

Do they actually work or am I screwed? I want to work into a healthy diet as soon as I can. But I need SOMETHING to keep me going and alive until then. And something that doesn't make me hate myself (due to sugar) when I eat it.

663,Is this a healthy diet in the long run ?,"Am 27 today. Last year, I went through a crisis and ate so much sugar I was disgusted with myself.

I've since permanently put myself on an extremely low-sugar diet for the rest of my life.

I was eating whole boxes of cookies and whole cakes on the weekends. I compensated by eating less carbs throughout the week and cutting out sugary or fatty dressings. And I switched to vegan ketchup(less than 1g sugar per tbsp) and organic mustard (55g sodium per  tbsp). Sometimes, I was eating a few cookies a day or a few over the course of the week.

As part of my detox, I have given up processed meat (lunch meat like baloney and such), ham, pork, hot dogs, bacon, sausage, salami, liverwurst.

Actually, I do ham, pork, sausage once a month. I'll eat all these in a month, but not more than once. I only eat ground turkey or ground beef or chicken (i get all these from my grocery store in town, from the butcher. i don't buy cheap packaged meat) or high quality canned meats like tuna or chicken (that have little or no fat in them). Not canned pork. I also try to eat organic bread that has lower sodium and 1g sugar per slice.

My daily meals consist of meat, peanut butter, oatmeal (less than gram sugar per half cup), or protein bars (never anything more than 10g total fat or 4g sat fat or more than 6 or 8 grams sugar). I cook everything. I don't drink soda or any juice drinks, actually haven't since I gave them up at 18. I only drink water, and use two packets of sugar free drink mix(these contain aspartame) a day. Sometimes, I use sugar free jelly with my peanut butter(it's made with splenda, by smuckers. 0.5g sugar per tbsp); no more than two tbsp a day. I have a whole cup of oatmeal every day(cause it's less sugary than eating vegetables and has a lot of fiber and my bread also has a lot of fiber. 5g per slice) and no more than two or three tbsp of peanut butter (it's a natural brand, 2g sugar and 16 total fat and 3 sat fat per serving).
I also cut out cheese to reduce fat intake so I can have peanut butter every day. Sometimes I cook my meat in fat, but I actually usually drain it all out as it cooks. I'm thinking about only having boiled eggs from now on to reduce fat intake.

I still have my sweets, but only once or twice on weekends and I try to keep my daily sugar intake below 16 on the weekdays. Some days, I can total 13 or 8 grams. I might eat 25 grams or more on the weekends, but I'm kinda trying to do no-fat sweets or just adding a ton of spices and sweety stuff to my oatmeal (go crazy that way). I don't use butter in my oatmeal to cut down on fat.

I stopped drinking regular milk and switched to unsweetened plant milk(has no sugar, is lower fat/carb) or protein flax milk (has more protein, same no-sugar and low carbs/fat).

Aside from the weekend sweets, I eat a whole pizza once a month (10 or 12 slices). But I'm contemplating (i actually did this this month) eating the pizza without the cheese and only eating the dough and meat/veggies/fruit. I basically stripped off the cheese from the slices, put the toppings back, and ate every piece with my vegan ketchup and seasonings (i got into using no/low sodium/salt/sugar seasons). Half of my pieces are vegetable/fruit and half are meat. I only meats on my pizza: chicken or beef or sausage or ham. No pepperoni.

Also, I don't eat fruit to cut back on sugar. Pizza day is the only day I get fruit in.

Some other details. I also stopped eating chips and ""snack"" foods when I was 18. Had some energy drinks in my teen years, but gave all those up around 18. Never done drugs of any kind. I am not the kind of person who has to ""salt"" his food. I only ever use pepper. My meat is usually plain unless it's something like a burger with ketchup and mustard, no cheese. Even with tacos and burritos, am considering giving up cheese. Don't even use sour cream with these, but still might use salsa.

I am worried for my heart, which is why I gave up cheese and a lot of fats. So I am trying to eat peanut butter and oatmeal everyday (for soluble fibers and unsaturated fats). The sweets I ate were pretty fatty. I was eating like this for a 4-7 month period before I started to dial it back and only eat sweets on weekends. 

I am also trying to eat eat avocados with my peanut butter (for the healthy fats).

Also, another thing to ask: All the binge'ing I did, can my body ""heal"" from all that or do just have to eat healthier from now on and *hope* ?

I have never actually binged on sweets in my life before. I mean, I ate that stuff as a kid but never like I did this year. The reason I get gave up soda was because I was drinking too much when I was 15 or so and my doc at the time said my blood pressure was high from it and I needed to stop and.. bad withdraws.

Also fast food; don't eat it more than 5 times a year, since I was 18. it's something else I gave up. probably not more than 3 times this year.",0,healthy diet long run,27 today last year went crisis

666,Can strawberry diet works?," The principle of diet

Strawberry diet is one of the detox diets. It has a positive effect on burdened organs. It takes just 3 days to get up to 4 kilograms. And what more? You’ll enjoy it. The first day is probably the hardest for you. You will only eat strawberries and drink plenty of water. The next day, you can add some extra food to the strawberries and prepare your body for the third day to return to normal eating.

667,How can I diet without my mom knowing?,"I am 13 year old boy who is 4’11” and about 89-90Ibs. I don’t wanna be fat at all. I want to diet. I used to eat popcorn everyday (Pop Weaver). I read nutrition facts of everything I see, but my mom threatens a doctor every time I do. My sister is skinny and I have never been called a bag of bones before. I have a plan. So first, I will sleep for 8-8.5 hours or so. I have no idea how hard it is to be thin. So I have a schedule. First, I will set an alarm to 4 AM to get up, sneak to the kitchen, sip water, and go back to bed. Next, I will eat cereal on the weekdays, pancakes Saturday, and cinnamon rolls Sunday. I can’t let my mom get suspicious, so I might set an alarm at 5 AM to sneak an orange, eat it, and go back to bed. I also drink sweetened Arizona Green Tea, I will cut back to once a day, and at times just hide it, have my sister drink it, or lie to my mom and say I got tired of it. After breakfast, I will go outside and sneak into my dad’s garage, use the exercise bike, and maybe lift weights, until lunch time where I eat something. Tomorrow, I plan on eating jelly toast (for whole grains) and salad for lunch. Then, I play on my computer for a bit, so my mom doesn’t get suspicious. I then go outside, bike around, and then come in to play video games so my mom doesn’t think I’ve given up screen time. I also drink a glass of water. Then for dinner, I will eat what my parents are making, as long as it is healthy. Tomorrow, we are eating out, so I might have my plans foiled for spaghetti (for whole grains), bacon (for protein), 2 cups of ensures (for more protein) and secret carrot sticks. I will then check the weight scale, see how much I weigh, and then go take a shower. Then, my mom will ask about my snacks, so for 4 days, I will eat popcorn, for 2 days, goldfish, and the last day, I need to decide. I can even hide the snacks if I want to like in the toilet or trash. Then I will go to bed at 10 PM.

 Sorry for so much rambling.

But anyways, I am scared that my mom will be suspicious about my diet. “Why did you cut back on popcorn?” “Why did you give up on pizza?” “Why do you now like vegetables?” “Why do you exercise as soon as you’re done eating?” If I tell her why, she will take me to my doctor and start me for therapy.

Right now I'm having trouble with actually losing the weight, despite the fact that I lift weights 6 times per week. My day of eating usually consists of lunch and dinner, I skip breakfast. Lunches are half a cup of brown rice, a chicken breast, 3 boiled eggs and hericot beans. Dinner is usually steak or chicken with sweet potato fries (10 to be exact), spinach, half a corn on the cob and more hericot beans. I only drink water. I'm 91kg and I've been 91kg for a while now, the numbers on the scale wont go down. If anyone could give me any sort of advice, I'd be very grateful. I decided to start eating porridge oates (quaker protein sachets) with black coffee for breakfast to see if it makes a difference, but I feel like I'm either undereating or overeating without realising, I'm still scratching my head over this all.

689,Completely changed diet overnight,"My wife was a little frustrated, as she had been asking me to change my eating for a while, but she had no ""plan"". I needed inspiration. At my physical the young woman doctor said told me one of the best ways to control weight was cut out meat and eat beans, etc. Well, I took that to heart. 

Cut out: meat, beer (tragic, but I'll have one for special occasions), bread (cornbread is OK) and cheese. 

Eating: Beans (pinto, black mostly), yogurt, pickled or sauteed veggies, fruit, tortillas, some nuts. 

Only a week and my neighbor noticed my belly has shrunk already. I have more energy, sleep better and my digestive system if more regular (I mean, what more can you ask?).

I have never been a real advocate of this, but I have taken to it with a will and enjoy the food. As a school trained cook I know about nutrition, but in addition to this, how to make this food taste good. I tried a black bean burrito at a small restaurant and it was so bland it was amazing. My pinto beans are cooked in an instant pot with seasonings, veggie broth, onion and garlic and are amazing. I am also thinking of my own recipes, like pinto bean/barley soup and a mushroom/barley soup as well. Seasoning is the key to this kind of cooking, using aromatics like onions, fennel, garlic, spices and herbs along with a little salt and pepper.

What's more, the huge bowl of ice cream, which is at least 3 times bigger than their regular ""BK Mix Oreo""  contains only 800 calories (which is just 300 cals more than the BK mix Oreo).

695,Dissertation weight gain,"Hi all,

I submitted my dissertation last week and I've realised that I gained a lot of weight whilst writing it. I did realise that I was gaining weight at the time, but I didn't realise that it was this bad. I'm currently 75kg, 5ft 6"" and 21 years old (F). 

I'm planning on doing the boiled egg diet and going to the gym every second day (so Monday, Wednesday, Friday, etc.) for the next month (at least). If I'm still not back to my normal weight by then, I'll just have to stick with that plan until I do get back to my normal weight, however long that takes. 

Has anyone got any other tips on how to lose this weight fast? I would like to be back to my normal weight by the time I graduate, which is in late June. I'm also on antidepressants, which I'm pretty sure have been making me gain weight as well, so any advice on how to deal with that would be much appreciated.",0,dissertation weight gain,hi submitted dissertation last week realised gained lot weight whilst writing realise gaining weight time realise bad currently 75kg 5ft 6 21 years old f planning boiled egg diet going gym every second day monday wednesday friday etc next month least still back normal weight stick plan get back normal weight however long takes anyone got tips lose weight fast would like back normal weight time graduate late june also antidepressants pretty sure making gain weight well advice deal would much appreciated,dissertation weight gain ,hi submitted dissertation last week realised gained lot weight whilst writing realise gaining weight time realise bad currently 75kg 5ft 6 21 year old f planning boiled egg diet going gym every second day monday wednesday friday etc next month least still back normal weight stick plan get back normal weight however long take anyone got tip lose weight fast would like back normal weight time graduate late june also antidepressant pretty sure making gain weight well advice deal would much appreciated ,dissert weight gain ,hi submit dissert last week realis gain lot weight whilst write realis gain weight time realis bad current 75kg 5ft 6 21 year old f plan boil egg diet go gym everi second day monday wednesday friday etc next month least still back normal weight stick plan get back normal weight howev long take anyon got tip lose weight fast would like back normal weight time graduat late june also antidepress pretti sure make gain weight well advic deal would much appreci

705,How to Lose Weight Fast Based on Science,"The point is Eating Protein, Fat and Vegetables.Each one of your meals should include a protein source, a fat source and low-carb vegetables.

Constructing your meals in this way will automatically bring your carb intake into the recommended range of 20–50 grams per day.

Protein Sources

Meat: Beef, chicken, pork, lamb, etc.

Fish and Seafood: Salmon, trout, shrimp, etc.

Eggs: Whole eggs with the yolk are best.

The importance of eating plenty of protein cannot be overstated.

This has been shown to boost metabolism by 80 to 100 calories per day.

High-protein diets can also reduce cravings and obsessive thoughts about food by 60%, reduce the desire for late-night snacking by half, and make you so full that you automatically eat 441 fewer calories per day — just by adding protein to your diet.

When it comes to losing weight, protein is the king of nutrients.Period.

Jen Wagner had always been athletic, but when she got married, she stopped working out and gained 100 pounds, reaching her highest weight of 240 pounds in 2017.

""I felt like a stranger in my own body. I didn't recognize my own reflection, and when I would see photos of myself, I was disgusted. I didn't know who that was,"" she told Popsugar.

&amp;#x200B;

Though she had tried for six years to lose weight on fad diets and different programs, she finally buckled down in February this year. She started with her diet, first on keto, then to low-carb. Now she tracks her calories using MyFitnessPal and does intermittent fasting.

&amp;#x200B;

She also exercises by playing tennis, swimming, walking with hand weights, jumping on trampolines with her daughter and even doing yard work.

&amp;#x200B;

""I never did something that made me miserable and not want to do it again,"" she told POPSUGAR. ""I haven't stepped foot inside of a gym even one time on this journey.""

713,some suggestions to lose weight!,"There are three suggestion for you to lose wight:

&amp;#x200B;

1.Start small. Don’t start a major diet and run 5 miles every morning and do rock climbing every weekend. You’ll burn yourself out. You’ll feel stressed by the time commitment. Make a small goal, maybe even with a finish line date (like the couch to 5K challenge I did) and do it. After success with a small goal you can try something bigger. And you’ll feel more confident from completing this first challenge you set for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. Love what you eat. I’ve had a few people ask me what my “secret” is since you can pretty easily see I love cookies and cake and pie (not to mention cheese and pasta and beer!). I eat what I love, but in moderation. Dieting has never worked for me. I do a bad job of keeping track of calories or points or whatever the new thing is. If that works for you, then do it. But I haven’t had any success with diets. I eat what I love in moderation. I have one or two cookies, instead of four or five. I make an effort to find fruits and vegetables that I love and eat those a lot more. I don’t eat, unless I’m hungry. I listen to my body and its needs. For me, keeping it simple like this is best. But I won’t lie. It does require some self control. Which is learned skill. And if I can do it, so can you!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. Do something active that you enjoy. You don’t have to go running if you hate running. It’s ok. If joining a gym doesn’t fit in your budget, don’t be discouraged. There are so many fun (and free) ways to get active. You could clean your house. Take your dog on a hike. Ride your bike to the grocery store. Volunteer to help pack boxes for a food pantry. Whatever. Just try to get active for an hour a few times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

715,Suggestions to lose weight!,"There are three suggestion for you to lose wight:

&amp;#x200B;

1.Start small. Don’t start a major diet and run 5 miles every morning and do rock climbing every weekend. You’ll burn yourself out. You’ll feel stressed by the time commitment. Make a small goal, maybe even with a finish line date (like the couch to 5K challenge I did) and do it. After success with a small goal you can try something bigger. And you’ll feel more confident from completing this first challenge you set for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. Love what you eat. I’ve had a few people ask me what my “secret” is since you can pretty easily see I love cookies and cake and pie (not to mention cheese and pasta and beer!). I eat what I love, but in moderation. Dieting has never worked for me. I do a bad job of keeping track of calories or points or whatever the new thing is. If that works for you, then do it. But I haven’t had any success with diets. I eat what I love in moderation. I have one or two cookies, instead of four or five. I make an effort to find fruits and vegetables that I love and eat those a lot more. I don’t eat, unless I’m hungry. I listen to my body and its needs. For me, keeping it simple like this is best. But I won’t lie. It does require some self control. Which is learned skill. And if I can do it, so can you!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. Do something active that you enjoy. You don’t have to go running if you hate running. It’s ok. If joining a gym doesn’t fit in your budget, don’t be discouraged. There are so many fun (and free) ways to get active. You could clean your house. Take your dog on a hike. Ride your bike to the grocery store. Volunteer to help pack boxes for a food pantry. Whatever. Just try to get active for an hour a few times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So to make this as short as possible, I’ve lost about 20-25 pounds  over the last 2 months after changing my diet and lifestyle choices. Well from a friend I was told I was doing it wrong since I wasn’t taking in enough calories and would crash my metabolism?

Well he informed me I need to be over 2000 since I now I float between 235-240 day to day and really haven’t lost weight since I changed to 2000 plus calories and around 200g of protein a day. Carbs I still keep relatively low around 50-70g a day.

So basically I’m getting frustrated since I haven’t been losing weight like I was and I’m debating going to my old diet to get to my goal and then go back to my current diet of 2000+ calories and what not since I seem to be staying at the weight i started it at.

722,Is it possible to change your appetite?,"We all know that one person who is thin but doesn't count calories or follow any rigid rules around eating. This could be attributed simply to genetics, however they usually are also the people who simply 'forget to eat' or who are content to only have a bit of something and not feel mentally deprived. Then there are those of us who are always thinking about our next meal, who feel mentally tortured when deprived or restricted from certain foods which we will inevitably overeat if given the chance. I'm not a fat person by any means, I exercise daily and consider myself quite fit, if I do say so myself. But I wish to rid myself of the power and mental space food takes up in my life. I have tried counting calories but it seems to unnatural to me and unsustainable, plus it severely limits my eating options when I go to parties or family's houses.

723,How to stop eating like this,"For the last 8 months, ever since I got my first job and started earning my own money I've been eating terribly. Everyday chips and chocolate bars, pop and something unhealthy for lunch at work. Usually some food from the hot deli we have, so fries, chicken fingers etc. Before this time period I was losing weight at a nice pace, then very rapidly when I first started work because it's really fast pace and I was still on my diet. But then I slipped up and let myself have junk and now I can't fucking stop. 

Should note that I feel like shit on a daily basis. This guy a work preemptively rejected me in October and I see him every week, multiple times a week. Nothing I can do about it. Still chasing him. We're friends.

Plus, even though I'm eating like a pig I'm currently maintaining, which I'm really happy about because I've lost over 115 pounds , so being able to maintain without counting calories is great. 

And because I'm maintaining, and my skin is all fucked up from the weight loss I have it in my head that if I just carry on eating like this, my skin will have time to form to my current body. Therefore I shouldn't lose anymore weight. 

I know this isn't really the case and that my skin is probably fucked.

So how the hell can I get out of this rut?

730,Anyone interested in having a diet buddy ?,"I am struggling to lose 4 kilos I’ve earned during the last 6 months. I am a 25 yo female with an office job that (most of the time) doesn’t require physical activity.

I do exercice a bit already every week.

I think I “just” need to eat less and avoid sugar/treats. And that is where it is difficult. 

I was wondering if someone here would be interested in being my “diet buddy”. 

What I mean is:
- someone to talk to when I am about to do something bad (eat a slice of cake). Even if this person doesn’t reply it will make me think about what I am going to do and help me take the right decision. 
- Someone I could send “I did well today/ 
I failed” at the end of the day. So I feel like I am not alone in this. I count my calories in an app but it’s easy to cheat when you don’t want to see the truth after failing another day... 
- someone to share progress with

731,How to guarantee that your diet will fail. AKA how people will run to fads and ignore the science.,"Let's start with this .. I tried it, He Keto , the Paleo, the Atkins, the Zone , the Cabbage, the detox.. ECT...

All Bullshit..  Most without a shred of actual  peer reviewed science to back it up.. You want to fail, jump on a fad or come up with your own wackyness. "" Ill eat only grapefruit for a week!"" 

It.. is.. going .. to fail, In the long run. 

There are only 4 real rules to losing weight.  1) counting calories .. 2) eating to the caloric debt.  3) The B/L/D eating regimen is so far out of bounds as to how our metabolism works, it is criminal as to how it fucks up the diet plan and keeps people fat.. Lastly.. 4) GET THE FUCKING SUGAR OUT OF YOUR DIET.. processed sugar calories are what keeps you overweight. 

Why people will dance about the most direct way to losing weight drive me nuts.  

I put myself and my wife on a diet of calorie count. followed the SCIENCE. Removed direct sugar calories and began eating a simple breakfast and nibbled and ate (allways counting calories) and kept the ravenous need to eat at bay that puts you into ""starvation"" and slows your metabolism. 

Here is a fact .. Fat does not make you fat .. you can metabolize fat pretty well, it is sugar bypassing the liver that MAKES FAT. 

CDC.. do not expect to lose more than 2 pounds a week. A 3 year study found those who lose 1- 2 pounds a week at most are most likey to keep the weight off.. You cannot afford to have your metabolism slow down in a ""starvation"" mode

Does it work .. 65 pounds down on my side, 35 on my wife's .. No more bullshit diets. and my blood sugar is down to near normal and reversing my type 2. .. B/L/D eating will fucking kill you. you need to not only count calories but change the very foundation of how we eat for this to work. 

Stop with the fads .. Lose weight slowly , get rid of the sugar, count those calories and eat to the caloric debt and you will be fine.",0,guarantee diet fail aka people run fads ignore science,let start tried keto paleo atkins zone cabbage detox ect bullshit without shred actual peer reviewed science back want fail jump fad come wackyness ill eat grapefruit week going fail long run 4 real rules losing weight 1 counting calories 2 eating caloric debt 3 b l eating regimen far bounds metabolism works criminal fucks diet plan keeps people fat lastly 4 get fucking sugar diet processed sugar calories keeps overweight people dance direct way losing weight drive nuts put wife diet calorie count followed science removed direct sugar calories began eating simple breakfast nibbled ate allways counting calories kept ravenous need eat bay puts starvation slows metabolism fact fat make fat metabolize fat pretty well sugar bypassing liver makes fat cdc expect lose 2 pounds week 3 year study found lose 1 2 pounds week likey keep weight cannot afford metabolism slow starvation mode work 65 pounds side 35 wife bullshit diets blood sugar near normal reversing type 2 b l eating fucking kill need count calories change foundation eat work stop fads lose weight slowly get rid sugar count calories eat caloric debt fine,guarantee diet fail aka people run fad ignore science ,let start tried keto paleo atkins zone cabbage detox ect bullshit without shred actual peer reviewed science back want fail jump fad come wackyness ill eat grapefruit week going fail long run 4 real rule losing weight 1 counting calorie 2 eating caloric debt 3 b l eating regimen far bound metabolism work criminal fuck diet plan keep people fat lastly 4 get fucking sugar diet processed sugar calorie keep overweight people dance direct way losing weight drive nut put wife diet calorie count followed science removed direct sugar calorie began eating simple breakfast nibbled ate allways counting calorie kept ravenous need eat bay put starvation slows metabolism fact fat make fat metabolize fat pretty well sugar bypassing liver make fat cdc expect lose 2 pound week 3 year study found lose 1 2 pound week likey keep weight can not afford metabolism slow starvation mode work 65 pound side 35 wife bullshit diet blood sugar near normal reversing type 2 b l eating fucking kill need count calorie change foundation eat work stop fad lose weight slowly get rid sugar count calorie eat caloric debt fine ,guarante diet fail aka peopl run fad ignor scienc ,let start tri keto paleo atkin zone cabbag detox ect bullshit without shred actual peer review scienc back want fail jump fad come wacky ill eat grapefruit week go fail long run 4 real rule lose weight 1 count calori 2 eat calor debt 3 b l eat regimen far bound metabol work crimin fuck diet plan keep peopl fat lastli 4 get fuck sugar diet process sugar calori keep overweight peopl danc direct way lose weight drive nut put wife diet calori count follow scienc remov direct sugar calori began eat simpl breakfast nibbl ate allway count calori kept raven need eat bay put starvat slow metabol fact fat make fat metabol fat pretti well sugar bypass liver make fat cdc expect lose 2 pound week 3 year studi found lose 1 2 pound week likey keep weight can not afford metabol slow starvat mode work 65 pound side 35 wife bullshit diet blood sugar near normal revers type 2 b l eat fuck kill need count calori chang foundat eat work stop fad lose weight slowli get rid sugar count calori eat calor debt fine 
732,Say no to food,"How do you find the will to say no to food? 

I want to loose 4 kilos that I earned during these last 6 months as it was a very stressful period for me. Some of my clothes don’t fit anymore and it annoys me. I feel “fat”.

I started a diet 4 weeks ago and at first it went really well... overall, I am eating way healthier. I just don’t buy things so I am not tempted. I found a “formula” that gives me enough energy to work during the day and feel good.

The problem is... there are always so many temptations... like a birthday cake at work, or someone who gives me chocolate/snacks, a day out of the office at a meeting where there is free food etc. And even if I am not hungry at all, when someone gives me bad food (plus obviously my diet isn’t full of unhealthy food so I miss it a little bit), I can’t resist .. and then the “cheat meal” becomes the “Cheat day”... and the cheat day the “cheat week”. And it’s quite depressing because I am trying my best but I have no self control over free food.

Also, I sort of have depression and anxiety and a stressful job... and food is the only friend I have some days... I really need it. But it doesn’t help my diet

739,"Good during week, horrible on weekend","I’ve been trying to eat healthier lately, in particular for fertility (which you’d think would be motivation enough... but clearly I’m not a very strong person...). I eat really healthy during the week, smoothie with protein powder on my drive in, pack a lunch of quinoa with veggies and chicken or ground beef daily for lunch, and cook for me and my husband every night when I get home...

But then Friday arrives (I work from home on Friday) and everything falls apart. Anything and everything in my cabinets (Oreos, candy, chips, pretzels) are snacks between otherwise healthy meals. And then Saturday and Sunday arrive and it gets even worse with girls nights packed with desserts, meeting friends at breweries and going out on date night. 

I love all these things and I’m not worried about my weight... but with trying to focus on fertility how do I decide how much is too much? Where do I set limits? How do I commit to “completely clean” and is that even needed? How much “living my life” is fine?

For the record, I’m 5’6”, 32 and 108-112 pounds depending on the day. I work out 2-4x a week depending on the week. So while I’d love to be more “fit” and look like Kayla itsines or something... this really isn’t about weight or not being active, it’s about fertility.

Thankfully I had only early stages of osteopenia (the little sister of osteoporosis), which were reversible at that point, and my doctor confirmed that she mostly treated skinny women with these issues who shunned carbs. 

She explained to me that carbs were like fuel for your organs: if you did not eat carbs, then your organs could not function 100%, and eventually your body would break down its' own bones for fuel. As soon as I re-incorporated carbs into my diet (quinoa, brown rice, brown pasta, etc) my levels of osteopenia normalised.

747,"Help, I can't give up chocolate!","I have a big issue with sugar. I've been eating it regularly (mostly chocolate) ever since I was a little child. I'm 28 and I'm used to eating chocolate pretty much everyday, and it became an issue probably 3 years ago, when my metabolism changed and I started gaining weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I do blood tests every year and they're all good, but I know sugar is an issue. The biggest issue is I can't stop. I will often tell myself it's just a piece but it's never just a piece. Sometimes I control myself enough not to buy chocolate but if there's chocolate around I'll eat it - and I work for a company where people love eating and everytime someone is out somewhere they bring back chocolate and candy, and I just can't say no.

&amp;#x200B;

I eat fine otherwise. I have regular meals and try to eat fruit and vegetables. I sleep well (9 hours per night). I have my 3 mains meals on time and snacks in between (either healthy yogurt, fruit, dry cookies, or the dreaded chocolate). I drink a lot of water and tea. I even go to the gym. But since I'm going to the gym and building muscle on top of the fat, I look bulkier as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I have a big issue with bloating. I bloat no matter what I eat. I wake up on a flat stomach, have breakfast (and I have tried a number of different foods for breakfast), and look like I'm 3 months pregnant as soon as I finish breakfast. I've lost count of the people who congratulated me on being pregnant in the past, and how much I cried over it. I know sugar makes me even more bloated but I often think ""I'm bloated anyway, why bother??"" I have seen three doctors just for the bloating and we tried different things but nothing worked and no one knows what to do and since I'm healthy, no one cares.

Hello all,

Survey is can be found here: [https://forms.gle/gH8fsT8uDva8EerSA](https://forms.gle/gH8fsT8uDva8EerSA)

We are a group of college students looking into understanding how food allergies can affect the grocery shopping process. We are trying to determine how common food allergies are and at what ages. The goal is to create an app that would enable users to enter their allergies (or dietary restrictions), enter the product they are looking for and then the app will generate a list of all said products that do not contain those allergens. The user will view a list of all grocery stores that sell the product near by.

If you have the time and you or someone in your family mainly does the grocery shopping for the household, please feel free to take the survey!

761,Trying to assemble a list of hidden sugars in everyday food,"I am trying to compile a list of ""where to look for hidden sugar"", and would like your opinion on what I have written so far: 

The hidden sugar in our diet is hard to find. You’ll be amazed at the things that have added and often unnecessary sugar inside. There are two things to look at, its not only the added sugar but the carbohydrates in the food. At the end of the day, carbs turn into sugar with the same effect on your blood sugar level:

1. Breakfast Cereal – Most of you could have guessed this one, but we’re not talking about the sugar in sugary cereal. We’re talking about hidden sugar in so-called healthy cereals. Some ""healthy"" cereals have more than 23 grams of sugar per serving.
2. Asian Food – Most restaurant-made or packaged Asian food has an enormous amount of sugar in it. Even sushi. The way you make sushi rice includes adding sugar to it. You can make your own Asian food to ensure that the sugar level is not too high.
3. Canned and Packaged Soups and Sauces – Thankfully, all you have to do is check the labels. Some yogurt has more than 15 grams of sugar! Even spaghetti sauce and gravy can have more sugar than a soda pop. If you want to be sure to eat less sugar, read labels and find no-sugar options or make your own.
4. Frozen Yogurt – Just because the word yogurt is in it doesn’t mean it’s healthy. It’s just as sugary as regular ice-cream. It’s a dessert. Treat it as if it’s a dessert. Don’t use it for a meal, and don’t believe you’re eating healthier. If you prefer real ice cream for a snack you are now free to eat it instead, as one is not better than the other when it comes to sugar.
5. Smoothies – They’re all the rage and there are many smoothie shops out there banking on it. But, most smoothie shops use fruit with added sugar which removes any benefits you would have from drinking a smoothie at all. If you make your own, watch it when recipes ask for dried fruit too. Using whole, fresh fruit is much better.
6. Bread – While there is some bread that is good for you, most bread is made with highly refined flour and sugar. Both of these affect blood sugar. Even wheat bread is high in sugar (Carbs), so you need to read the labels. Bread that is usually low in sugar is rye or spelt. Plus, you can make your own to avoid additives and sugar that can harm your health.
7. Condiments – You know we all like to dip everything. But, if you dip your fresh apples or celery into the wrong thing, you may be making matters worse. Instead, make your own condiments or read the labels. Today there are many low-sugar varieties of condiments, including low-sugar ketchup.
8. Canned Beans – Check the labels on canned beans, especially ones with any type of sauce on them like chili beans or baked beans. These are usually so high in sugar that if you compared it to a cake you wouldn’t know which was which just by the amount of sugar.
9. Muffins – You probably already realize that some muffins are high in sugar, but even the ones that sound healthy are just cakes in muffin form with a healthy flour or healthy name added. They are all high in sugar. There are some recipes for low-sugar muffins, though; just search the net and you’re sure to find them. You don’t have to do without, replacing regular flour with almond-flouer and sugar with xylit does the trick.
10. Yogurt – Just like frozen yogurt is high in sugar, so is most sweetened yogurt - including low-fat yogurt. The best way to combat this problem is to make your own yogurt or eat yogurt as a dessert. You can also buy plain yogurt and add your own fruit and stevia to create a low-sugar snack that is healthy due to the probiotics in yogurt.

Anything premade and packaged is in danger of having too much sugar. It’s best to read the labels and judge for yourself. Keep in mind that the average adult should not consume more than 90 grams, or 5 percent of their total calories, in added sugar daily. If you are on a low carb diet, the value is even less, around 50 grams a day, including carbs.

762,Bad habit of not eating,"I am a 19 year old male college student, and Ive been doing some weight loss lately. I always gain a lot of weight in the winter then lose it all come spring, so I range from 150 to 175, and Im 6’0 tall. I never really have been “chubby” or too big, just a little excess fat I dont like. I was proactive since january and have went from 175 to 155. My problem is I rarely eat when I get on the weight loss mindset. I take adderall in the morning and this automatically makes me not hungry until at least dinner time, where I will eat a medium sized meal and at max Ill eat a small snack during the day. Id say at max I eat 1200 calories a day. I understand this isnt healthy but everything on campus is soo unhealthy and I just assume eating one meal a day is better. I know this isnt helping me lose weight and im only holding onto body fat and thats why im trying to break this habit. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to eat more without gaining weight and continue to lose more weight?

764,"Relying on fat and glycogen stores, 1 large meal a day for replenishment","What do you guys think about 1-2 meals a day, allocating 70%+ of the calories to one single meal usually at some time during the evening?

Very , if you ask me. 😁  I recently started the 90 days diet , 13 days ago , and in this time i managed to go down from 126 kg to 118.5 kg. Seems good progress. To help myself and as a pledge ,i started to film daily vlogs about the progress. I hope that this will help me and maybe also some of you. I am a cab driver , which is the worse job if you want to lose weight. I wish you luck losing weight, and don't forget that everything is in your head. I have a friend who lost maaany kilos by just drinking water 25 days and not eating anything else. 
This sounds quite extreme ,but for him worked. So nothing is imposible.

775,"Looking to lose weight, few questions.","I’m motivated to lose weight. I’ll be 40 soon and suffering from flat feet and Plantar fasciitis pain. The Plantar fasciitis pain is new within the last year and I feel it has everything to do with weight gain. The pain is what is driving me to make changes. It’s not affordable to resolve (surgery required) due to the cost it won’t be in the foreseeable future. However, if I were to loose 100lbs (I’m 300) I can see that as a potential for less pain as I wouldn’t be carrying around as much weight.

I’m in the research phase right now, but looking to act soon. There are so many diet plans available it’s pretty over whelming for someone that’s never taken care of them self’s or cared enough to think about the implications it would have on one’s self. I’ve always just been comfy with me.

Things you should know. I intend to diet and also use an elliptical machine. With the zero impact I believe that can work for me to manage the feet pain. The other is I have ADHD. Which means anything gratifying like sweet foods I have a really hard time on portion control and just endlessly eat them. Seriously, leave a dozen donuts with me. I’ll have them things all eaten by the end of the day, or I’ll die trying.

I believe diet wise the best kind that could work for me a liquid or shake diet. I say that because it’s easy to take with me to work. It automatically addresses portion control for me. It’s a lot easier to drink something that may not appeal to me then it is to eat something like a frozen nasty diet meal of some sort.   Only like a few Veggies, drink would be ideal for me.

I only have one staple that I cannot do without (see link below). This tea has zero calories, far as the fine print I don’t see anything wrong with consuming it or conflict of interests. But it’s important to note I drink a gallon a day. That’s not a typo, I have for twenty years. The last 5 I switched to diet to cut out all the sugar. [https://www.turkeyhill.com/drinks/iced-tea/diet-iced-tea](https://www.turkeyhill.com/drinks/iced-tea/diet-iced-tea)

If you’ve read this far, thank you! I’d much appreciate any recommendations you may have for the type of diet I’m looking for and what kind of success you’ve had with it.   Much appreciated for any advice!

783,Need help coming up with a reasonable meal plan for Hashimoto’s while weightlifting,"Hello, I’m a 25 year old female and I have the mad struggle. I got diagnosed with Hashimoto’s last fall (late August 2018) after gaining like over (45 lbs) 20.5 kg in 3 months. I was doing well on a 1900 kcal diet and around 45 mg of Armour Thyroid then my weight loss plateaued. I also got like super busy with work and other stuff plus I noticed that my appetite increased with my workout sessions. I’m looking at about 165 lbs (75 kg right now) and is like to get down to my OG weight while maintaining most of my strength and lean muscle. 

Right now I’m doing Bret Contreras’ Gluteal Goddess for Advanced Lifters program and supplementing with accessory lifts and cardio on days off. 

I’m ballparking around 1500-1700 for sustainable weight loss but I’m running out of ideas on what to eat. I can’t figure out a macro split that works well and is easy to maintain plus keeps my palate entertained. I get bored very easily so I cannot do same dish 5 days in a row (at one point I ate so much chicken due to meal prep I literally began gagging when I ate it.) My endocrinologist recommended AIP or Gluten Free but I can’t freaking do that. All the Gluten Free crap that isn’t keto makes me sluggish and is high in carbs. I tried doing keto before but my strength plummeted and I was never in true keto because I didn’t want to cut my protein (still wanted to maintain lean muscle mass.) So no keto please. 

Can someone please halp?

TLDR; 25 year old female needs a non AIP non gluten free macro split and meal plan (1500-1700 kcal) that is sustainable and not boring.

804,"I (16m) threw up my breakfast, and I'm not sure why","Hello everyone, so about 3-4 days ago I started a new diet to gain weight. I'm getting into body building and would like to start good habits for when my metabolism slows down (it's currently very high), but I haven't been feeling great lately. My new diet (typically two large meals a day) consists of eggs, meat (ground beef), protein shakes, protein bars, and the occasional fruits (pears and apples mostly). So today I woke up at 5:30 am, finished my workout around 7 am, drank my protein shake around 7 am, and made my first meal around 9:30 am (pound of ground beef with 5 eggs). I felt great until around 1 pm, I developed a sore throat. I then puked and felt fine afterwards. Is my body just sick of the same two meals everyday, or should I be adding in something else? It could also be because my dad was sick (had a sore throat), but he's been out of town for a few days now. Plus after I threw up my throat stopped hurting. ALSO with this new diet, I'm trying to cut out carbs and sugar entirely. Could that also be a factor?

806,Cheat Meal,"Hello guys, I need some advice from the community about cheat meal. 


I am currently 27 years old. I currently weight 119 kg (262 lb) and 1.77m (5.7ft) . 1 month and a week ago i was 134 kg (295 lb) which is obese. So I started cutting my calories and only ate fruits and veggies. i had like an apple for breakfast , tuna salad for lunch and fruits like grapes or 2 oranges for dinner (5 pm) never ate past 6 pm. 

So fast forward I lost 30 lb, after the first three weeks, i feel like my weight almost stopped dropping , only 1 lb per 3-4 days. So I went to google the problem and found out that my body metabolism might have slowed down because of the lack of Leptin from carbs and the solution is to have a cheat meal once a week.


Is it true that a cheat meal is a must to boost the leptin rise again? Or is it untrue? If anyone could help enlighten the situation I would be pretty thankful.

edit: If a cheat meal is a must does a 300g(rice) curry rice with carrots , kimchi, and a boiled shrimp good for the meal? Or do i need to cut the rice to 200g?

808,Low calories diet,"  

Hi everybody! I’m a 24 years old girl and I need some help. Last week I started a low calories diet, without any kind of sugar and low carbs level. But I feel veeeery low and tired and depressed.  
 In the past I’ve suffered from bulimia, I used to eat too much -expecially sugar and junk food- and that’s why my weight increased in a very short time (even if I’ve tried to throw up everything). Now I’m trying to heal myself and my body, and I want to see the food like my friend, I’m trying to kick out all the toxins from my body and I wanna be a good-looking person. 

I go to university - I pass the most of the time sitting for studying and during the exams period I’m really anxious and I vent on food – Now I wanna lose fat, so I’m working out (with a lightly level) and that’s why I need a low calories diet, but my mind is down and I need something to cheer me up. Can you help me?

Maybe the bug is in the diet?

It’s based on: Oat milk and spelt flakes for breakfast, beans and whole grains cereals for lunch, animals proteins (eggs, fish, meat) with soluble fibers (vegetables) for dinner. Away from the main meal I eat some fruits. 

I workout every day (love when endorphins pervade the brain). 

Hope someone can give me a suggestion.

817,Why Keto didn’t work for me — anyone has same experience?,"I understand that bodies react to diets differently, and I know a few people who lost weight on Keto I’m not sure if they’re still on it. It’s unfortunate though that my body seems to reject it. Anyway this is a long one! Sorry.

A year and a half ago, I first tried keto. I really cut down on carbs and sugar, and did my own salad and cooked my meats. I did lose weight, however I felt sick after weeks on the diet. I thought it was maybe allergies, but when I went to the ENT she diagnosed me with Laryngopharangeal reflux or LRP. It turned out it was my acid reflux that’s triggering my allergies and rhinitis. She put me on PPIs and allergy meds for a couple of weeks, after which I felt so much better. I also quit the keto diet.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, I went back on the Keto diet because I wanted to lose weight faster (I know, not a good mindset) for a wedding I’m attending this week. I was strictly on very low or almost no sugar, and high fat diet and veggies. Last Wednesday night, I experienced some stomach cramps and I couldn’t go to sleep. I must have slept for like 3 hours, and had to go to a meeting. I didn’t really have a proper meal the whole day and just had a small sausage and small portion of eggs. I just knew something was not right so I went to the ER to get my stomach cramps checked, and I was so surprised that it wasn’t even the problem. My blood pressure shot up to 170/100. It was the first time this happened to me! My blood pressure is usually 120/80 or 110/70. I just couldn’t believe it. I stayed at the hospital for about 4 hours because my doctor won’t allow me to leave until it drops to normal. Eventually it got to 140/80 which is still a bit high for my standards. He put me on Amlodipine for a few weeks and asked to monitor my BP if it shoots up again. He also advised me to consult a dietician if it’s the right diet for me. 

I decided to quit the Keto diet after that. I was so scared. It’s the first time it happened to me and I don’t want to be on any maintenance meds. I’m hoping I won’t have to and so far my BP has dropped to 120/70 or 110/70 again.

To be fair, I’m not certain it’s the Keto diet that caused my BP to shoot up as I had lack of sleep, no food, and stressed that day. But I feel better now and I really don’t think it’s worth it to risk experiencing it again. So far I’ve been eating a balanced diet and going for runs. It’s not even about losing weight for me now but being healthy. But of course I’d want to get fit too :)

TL; DR — I quit Keto because I fell ill twice.

820,Simple Diet,"To really see best results from any diet plan you choose to use, you need to learn a few “diet commandments.” These are guidelines that must be followed if you are going to see superior results that will help propel you forward.

Sadly, many people miss out on one or more of these and it greatly costs them their success.

Want to learn more? Check out the list of five commandments below.

**Thou Shall Eat More Protein**

Of all the foods that you could eat while on a fat loss diet, protein is perhaps the most important. Protein helps combat hunger, it helps stabilize blood glucose levels, and it helps prevent lean muscle mass loss. This in turn helps speed up your metabolism and accelerates the process of fat loss.

Don’t let your diet intake fall short. Aim to eat some protein in each and every meal and snack that you consume.

**Thou Shall Eat Regularly**

While the concept that your metabolism will increase the more often you eat isn’t entirely accurate — as the boost you get after a meal is directly related to the size of that meal — eating regularly does help to keep hunger at bay.

By feeding your body frequently throughout the day, you’ll help avoid food cravings and energy lows, making it that much easier to stick to your diet program.

**Thou Shall Prioritize Fresh Foods**

When selecting your foods, eating fresh is a must. We live in a world where processed foods are around every corner and just waiting to cause us weight gain.

Eliminate these and you’ll really give your diet a boost. Focus on foods in their natural state — fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and oils, and lean proteins.

If you only make one change to your diet plan, make it this one.

**Thou Shall Set Short-Term Goals**

One diet rule that you should abide by and follow is to always set short-term goals for yourself. Think about what you are doing in the here and now, not months from now. It’s too easy to lose sight of your goals if they are going to take place six months to a year down the road.

Try thinking in three-week segments. Three weeks is about how long it takes for good habits to form, so it is the perfect amount of time to build behaviors that will stand the test of time.

This is precisely why The 3 Week Diet was created. It will help you stay motivated and consistent until you don’t even have to think about making those changes any longer. They’ll just be automatic.

**Thou Shall Stop Comparisons**

Finally, stop comparing yourself to others. Realize that this is your own journey and your own body. It’s unlike anyone else’s so you simply can’t expect to see the same results as everyone else.

821,Do I Eat Enough Protein? Most Don’t.,"Two and half months ago, I asked an athletic friend what could be the reason for my gym performance not increasing over time. After all, I had been going to the gym since 2015, while more or less following the **Slow**\-**Carb Diet** throughout the period.

Yes, at first everything seemed to work. I was following the workout regime from **The 4-Hour Body** by **Tim Ferriss**, meanwhile only eating lean meat, beans and veggies. No white foods like sugar, pasta, rice, bread or cheese on most days. And the weight + strength seemed to be increasing.

But over time, the process seemed to slow down and basically stop. I was still going to the gym and eating well. Even tried to change the exercise regime a bit. Yet, this did not seem to be enough. And when the results stop coming then the motivation starts to fade as well.

His answer was somewhat surprising, as I did not think he would be one to care about the food going in. Especially as his breakfast tends to be a bar of chocolate and some shady energy drink — no supplements, tho. But there he was, recommending me to start **counting calories**, *which he apparently also did.*

So on January 2nd, I downloaded **MyFitnessPal**, an app that asks you to enter all the foods you eat through the day. Either scan the packages or search for them individually — even most Estonian brands can be found from there. And now I have been using it for the last 2.5 months.

The app itself is great as it lets you choose the desired result and calculates the needed daily calorie intake, dividing it between carbs, fats and proteins. If you were to pay for it, then it even suggests the meals to eat. However, that is not necessary.

My first discovery after using it for a week was that I did not fulfil even the bare minimum of daily suggested protein intake. Not just the minimum to grow muscle but the minimum to even function as a healthy person.

Apparently, people should consume 1 gram of protein per 1 kilogram of their weight, daily. Meanwhile, to grow muscle, this should be increased to 2–2.5 grams per kilogram. However, I was constantly getting only 0.85–0.9 grams per kilogram, even though I thought I was eating enough. No wonder that the results were not increasing.

Looking into it, the research shows that most people have the same problem. We talk about eating too many carbs and fat. But the big issue is that we do not eat enough protein!

Anyway, after fixing this, I started to see an increase in the size of weights I can lift, as well as how fast I recover. Basically, I have almost doubled the weights since, while my Oura ring says that I sleep much better.

So what have I changed in eating since? Not much else but the quantity of meat and other food. In fact, most of my protein intake comes from eating chicken, cottage cheese, curd cream, kidney beans and an occasional protein shake. I also try to eat more eggs but have not done too much of that, so far.

However, I have realised that eating out is a no-no. Not because it would be hard to count the calories there but because the amount of protein per meal is not sufficient. And if anything then Subway seems to be one of the best places to get the protein from — but it also comes with so many carbs that it does not make sense.

As a bonus, I also realised that I did not get much of anything out of breakfast. I could, of course, eat 3–4 eggs and get a lot of protein. But until now, I have not been a big breakfast eater. So after hearing a bunch about the **intermittent fasting** where one only eats during an 8-hour window, I decided to test it out. Let’s see whether it helps anything…

827,DANGER. What veganism and calorie restriction did to my body,"Recently I decided to start dieting and exercising again. I was 25 yrs old, 5”11 and 167 lbs when I began last year, and it became a whole new obsession... gone wrong. At first I just ate small healthy meals, with some animal products and frequent exercise. Even though I indulged in binger snacks sometimes, I lost 25-30 lbs from that alone within months, however, I was never happy with how skinny I was even at a mere 140 lb’s. I wanted to be even thinner. So...

Within the past weeks I began researching different diets. I decided the CRON diet (calorie restriction and optimal nutrition) was best for me, and began to eat 100% animal product free (mistakenly assuming I needed to).

The worst part... I only ate 1500-1600 calories a day for weeks. I quickly dropped 5 lbs in the first week, which was fast, but I loved the way I looked, at first. I quickly started losing even more weight. Little did I know I was actually 130 lbs at the end of it all (underweight) and mistaking my water weight for an actual 135 lbs every time I stepped on the scale. But I continued to eat only 1600 calories “just in case” and out of fear of being “fat again”.

It wasn’t until I began wasting away that I realized I was undereating. But my stomach never told me. By this time, my hunger signals weakened to the extent that I didn’t know when I was hungry anymore. I was in starvation mode every day. And not just that, I wasn’t getting any iron from meats or fish either.

Here is what I looked like! (Beware- scary skinny. February 2019)
https://ibb.co/8g18BRC

I am not mentally ill or anorexic and I will never eat less than I need to feel healthy. I have since increased my calorie intake to around 1900 and my weight is back to fluctuating around 135-140 lb’s.

Beware! You may be starving yourself and not even know it. Avoid extreme calorie restriction even if the food is nutritious. Veganism is a slippery slope to a multitude of health problems.

828,I'm switching up my diet and trying to eat as little fat as possible. I need advice/reassurance that I won't die,"I've gone from 358lbs to 285lbs on the Keto diet(I'm a 5'8"" male) and I've been at a stall for weeks now. So being a crazy person and just generally interested in what it does to me, I want to switch it up and see what an ultra low fat, high protein diet does for me. I'm going to attempt to eat 1500-1800 calories a day, with 1g protein per pound of body weight, and as little fat as possible. I will also be starting a lifting routine.

What do you envision this will do to my body over the next few months, and, this is the important question, will it kill me? I'm fine with suffering as long as I don't die, lol. I'm very new to dieting(only started Keto a few months ago) so forgive me if it's a stupid question.

830,Feel like you are not in control of your life? Try Prolengua!,"Hi all - I have struggled with my eating since I was a child doing weight watchers with my mom back in 5th grade (probably too early to start to be fair). 

&amp;#x200B;

The primary contributor to my struggles was not feeling responsible for what happened in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I would blame people for bringing snacks around. I would blame the weather for why I couldn't exercise. I would let someone making fun of me ""force me"" to over eat.

&amp;#x200B;

My emotional and diet life was determined by my outside circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

I have come to realize, however, that this can be fixed by changing your paradigm and accepting that you are RESPONSIBLE for what happens in your life.  You can decide to let outside factors affect your decisions and eating habits, but that does not have to be the case.

&amp;#x200B;

As such, I am developing a tool called [Prolengua](https://www.prolengua.com/) to help people take control of their emotions and decisions.  

&amp;#x200B;

It is an AI-driven platform that monitors your speech and encourages the use of proactive language.

&amp;#x200B;

Research shows that the language we use, affects the way that we think, which in turn affects what we do. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we are building Prolengua to help people take control of their lives, by taking control of their language.

831,Can I lose weight by not eating at all?,"Hello, I'm an overeater, I really just can't stop once I put my hands on some food. It's not only junk food, just literally anything that will make me feel like I have filled the void inside myself (sorry if this sounds melodramatic but it's how it is) until I purge and then cook something else. I'm at 260 pounds x 5'2, I can't sleep at night because I can't breathe if I'm not sleeping on my side and get anxious so I hyperventilate and go on like this until I'm exhausted getting 1-2 hours of sleep at night.

834,I've just realised I barely eat 1000 calories per day.,"I have been very skinny/underweight all my life. It's always been a thing in my family so I never thought much of it.

I never counted calories, or worried about food. I actually -used to- love food. 

I eat anything at any time, it's really no problem at all for me. However I think I've tried so different type of foods that I am not even interested anymore, I don't think 'mhmmm I really want that'... It doesn't happen anymore :'(  


And I have also just realised that sometimes I eat way less than what I am meant to. I don't do it on purpose, it just really happens, out of laziness mostly.... the problem is the more I do it the more I get full quickly. Which means I am gonna eat less and less... I need to stop this situation but I don't know how to. 

I don't want to spend too much money on food either and I get bored of food quickly these days...

837,Diet plan draft for cutting,"Hi everyone.  I've been bodybuilding for about 3 years now.  Started of extremely skinny (I could touch finger to thumb around bicep).  Could not gain weight for the life of me.  Gradually gained weight by eating a tonne of food, lifting weights and drinking protein shakes and have been able to gain 2 stone.

Now I want to work on my diet to try tone up a bit (I've never made a diet plan as I've always been too skinny).  If anyone could review it and let me know what you think it would be much appreciated.

FYI I am not a picky eater, I could literally eat the same thing everyday.  I just need an opinion on the nutrients side of things.  Do the macros look good enough for muscle development and fat loss?

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I want to get my life back in order.  I've been depressed for a long time and it's lead to the devolution of most of my good eating habits, thus making it near impossible to ever overcome said depression.  Does anyone have any good concrete recommendations on building a healthy diet so that I can feel better on a day to day basis, have more energy, and hopefully overcome my depression?  I'm only 128lbs rn as a 20 year old male, so I'm not really worried about losing weight or anything, but I feel like I need a good defined regime to help get me back on track, especially because I've sorta been starving myself for the last 7 or 8 months out of a lack of motivation or knowledge of good things to eat.  


So yeah, treat me like an idiot, because I've basically forgotten everything my parents and school taught me throughout my childhood.  I'm still trying to get the hang of \*brushing my teeth\* after being in this depressed slump.  I've only recently found the desire or motivation necessary to even start pulling myself out of my own hole.  And that's why I'm turning to ya'll for help.  I can't do it on my own.

847,Been Dieting for Two Weeks Questions About Diet,"Hey guys my first post here so just have a few questions. I am a heavy guy (300+, 5'11) so I looked up my base metabolic and I got a range of 2500 to 3500, so I am going with 2500 BMR.  So I set my diet to just be 1500 calories and out of the last two weeks I have only hit that number 3 times on days I didn't go to the gym.

What I eat (day 1-11) (Calorie count is according to Myplate app)

Break fast  (304 calories)

\- Two eggs and 3 pieces of bacon

Lunch and Dinner (381 each meal)

\- Braised Chicken thigh

\- Half a cup of green beans

\- Three cherry tomatoes

Gym Routine:

\- Usually I do the elliptical for 20 mins + the 5 min cool down thing it tells me to do, so its about 2 miles and i burn like 350-400 calories depending on the day. My goal is usually to burn a meal from the elliptical alone

\- Then I do Shoulder press machine for 10 reps then 7, 5,3, and then repeat.

\- Next I do some other arm and shoulder machines (same amount of reps as shoulder press) that I honestly dont know what there called but I do em like the monkey i am LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading my post.

TLDR: I have been dieting and working out for 2 weeks, minimal carbs (33 avg) Wondering about my calorie intake since I usually aim for like 1300 from just eating and then I burn at least 300 of it from running the elliptical alone. I go to uni, so besides the work out i posted above I dont do much really. Just wondering about my calorie intake.

848,Keto ... Low Carb ... Atkins ... Fad Diets? No Thanks! Time to get back to basics,"There is a reason why supermodels eat a bunch of brown rice.  I'll give you a hint.  It's not evil and it will not make you fat as the sellers of the various low carb fad diets will have you believe.  Do you know what will make you fat?  Yup, animal food, dairy, cheese, sugar, processed food, sugary drinks, etc.

If you think avoiding brown rice (as well as other whole grains and legumes) and eating a ton of animal protein and fat is going to make you thin and healthy you are seriously delusional.

The blue zone diet.  The Mediterranean diet.  The diet the Mayo clinic recommends.  Low in total calories, rich in soluble fiber and complex carbohydrates, moderate in protein, and Low - yes thats right Low! in saturated fat and low on simple sugars- Low in animal protein and fat, and low in dairy - yes this is the diet of centenarians, this is the diet that will significantly reduce the risk of being overweight, having high cholesterol, having hypertension --- not the bullshit keto diet, atkins diet, or low carb diet - these are fads that lead to a slimmming waist and then a rubber band effect.

The Beck Diet Solution is an approach to dieting based on cognitive behaviours. You read one small chapter each day, and add new practices to reinforce the helpful behaviours.

I did most of the book last year, and found it very helpful. Like many other times, life got busy and I let the good habits I learned slide. I’d like to start back at day 1, and would love to have a few people to do it with to keep each other accountable.

The book is available on Amazon electronically for about $10. I’m sure it’s also available at many other book stores.

Anyone care to join me?

855,Do you lose weight faster if you've lost weight before?,"3 years ago I went on a calorie controlled diet and lost about 2 lbs every week or so (it was usually around 3 lbs a week but that wasn't intentional).

Thankfully I feel able to do it again now and have been dieting since Thursday, I've so far lost about 6-7 lbs (though I understand a lot of this is likely water weight).

863,What Is Keto Diet And How To Start With It," Among the various dietary methods that are being offered nowadays, keto diet is one of the methods that have been proven to be beneficial for those who want to lose weight. Moreover, this diet is very simple to do and doesn’t require you to follow complicated rules, as it is based on one simple principle: lowering the carbs intake in your body.

## So, What Is Keto Diet?

The term “keto” is short for ketogenic, which is essentially the main  goal of this diet. In an effort to reduce the intake of glucose and  switch your body fully into fat-burning processes for energy production,  you need to lower the intake of carbs that are usually used by your  body to produce energy by turning them into glucose.

879,Protein from Greek yogurt vs. powdered protein- pound for pound- which is better?,"All through my life, I’ve found it extremely hard to eat enough veggies. Lately, due to health issues regarding digestion and hypertension, I’ve finally told myself, enough is enough, I’m tired of people telling me I’m sick because I eat like crap. 

So I decided I’d like to start drinking my veggies vs eating them and it’s been working out great. One issue is, I pack all these veggies in my blender and they only fill me up for like an hour. Then I’m searching for some “real food” soon after. I was reading around and I came across an article stating that the protein marketed towards body builders can actually help you lose weight in the way of keeping you full longer without the urge to keep eating. This sounded like the answer for me. So I started looking ...

 I soon realized all these powders are chocolate or vanilla .. The closest one I found that might mix with my smoothies is a strawberry flavor but even that doesn’t sound too good to be honest( artificial strawberry flavoring has a unique taste of its own). I soon started to search for “high protein foods” and found Greek yogurt. It actually has about the same calories and same protein per serving as the powder. I just mixed it with my first smoothie about 30 minutes ago and it worked out pretty well.  By itself, it taste disgusting as I bought the plain one to get the most protein with the least amount of calories... 


Is this plain Greek yogurt (that has the same amount of protein and calories) going to essentially do the same as the powder stuff would? Or does that powder have other ingredients that make it more effective.

882,"Started Dieting and Hitting the Gym, But I'm Never Hungry!?","Hey everyone.  This is my first post here, so forgive me for any procedural errors.

I am a 24-years old, male, between 5""10 and 5""11.  I've always been heavier/huskier but I really began to put on weight during college and, now, law school.  I am in the mid-240s.  I have no business being this weight, and in the LONG term I hope to get down to about 180, and then see where to go from there.  

Anyways, my friend who was once very heavy is now quite slim, and he told me it all comes down to counting calories, so I have been doing that.  I am really limiting myself to under 1600 calories a day for a theoretical 2 lbs/week loss.  If I find I cannot stick with this, I will up my calories a bit so I do not ""burn out."" I have been also eating better foods (raw and grilled mixed vegetables, raw spinach, artichoke hearts, hard-boiled eggs, and grilled meat (usually chicken, occasionally beef)).  I have also begun to hit the gym three times a week (going HARD on an elliptical for 35 min, going just around 4 miles in that time). I also snack on bananas or 90-calorie granola bars throughout the day. I drink mostly water, coffee when I need it (splash of cream), and sometimes milk. Never soda, etc.

Now for my question: In spite of consuming fewer calories, working out, etc., I find that I am actually LESS hungry than I was before I began these lifestyle changes.  I am not craving food, and am satisfied during the day without even coming close to my 1600 calorie limit! (I'll eat about 1000 in a day and feel just fine). What's going on??

886,Diet Advice?,"I posted in another forum for advice but it got deleted so I wanted to see if anyone here could help me?

I have a long history of eating disorders. Most recently I had started eating around 900 calories per day and got down to about 105 lbs. I spoke to a dietitian and was advised to increase to about 1500. She said that I would maintain at that and simply not lose any more, but I've already started gaining. 

So basically now I'm panicking. I don't really know what to do. I usually maintain around 120 lbs, but I'm terrified that I will keep gaining forever. I've been overweight as a kid, severely underweight for most of my adult life, and I really just want to maintain and be happy and not worry about this stuff anymore. It's just really hard.

Any advice? Is 1500 too much for a totally sedentary 25 year old who is 5'4""? It seems like a lot.

Whether it's 4 in the afternoon or 10:30 at night, I feel an extreme sleepiness that I can't really do anything about and I'm pulled into a deep sleep and it doesn't end until it's done. I do feel great when I wake up, but before I sometimes didn't even feel like I needed to sleep some nights.   


I do drink alcohol also, just moderately, but I may need to quit entirely for the sake of my health and fitness goals.  I've sometimes felt like throwing up after some of my workouts.   


I imagine this is mostly due to my body adjusting to a new regimen and adapting to some new stresses, but I'd just like to throw this up here(no pun intended) to see if anyone thinks I have cancer cuz I know it's most likely why I'm getting this ungodly sleepiness.

But I feel better when I don't eat anything sweet- until this inevitable crash.

When I get home a few hours later, I usually eat something with peanut butter. A slice of bread with PB, maybe some apples and PB, then drink milk or something. Then I head out to CrossFit and workout. When I get home, I eat dinner.

914,Prescription Diet Pills,"Hello all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I was put on a medication called Zyprexa a few months back and it made me gain twenty pounds. Since then I've stopped it, but now I'm 5'7"" and 150 pounds. I've been off of it for a month and a half. I've been dieting and exercising like a madwoman, but I've only lost about two pounds. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: according to the internet, I'm at a healthy weight (on the higher end of the spectrum, though). However, this is a larger size for me that I am NOT comfortable with at all. I'm ashamed to walk out of the door and I refuse to date. I wear super baggy clothes now...

&amp;#x200B;

At this weight, will my doctor find any issues with prescribing me a diet pill? I've never been on one before and I'm genuinely having a difficult time losing the weight that my previous medication made me gain (which I blame my doctor for.) I burn off 800-1000 calories a day, but I still have a ton of trouble losing anything. 

  
What do you think?

920,Am I thinking about this correctly?,"Hello - looking for some guidance on my weight loss plan.

Background: former D1 athlete used to eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.  Transitioned into a desk job and have basically gained 40lbs of fat, though maintained a decent level of fitness so have kept some of the muscle I put on during my collegiate career (27y/o 5'11'' @ ~250)


Exercise plan: Orange theory 3-5x per week (700-850 kcal per workout according to apple watch) and potentially 1-2 swim workouts (~500 kcal per workout according to apple watch) - idea being something where I get my heart rate up almost every day.


Diet Plan: Just did a TDEE on an online calculator and it said 3300 based on my current workout routine from above, a day.  That seems ridiculously high to me.  My aim is to eat a 2000 calorie diet having &lt;100g of carbs, between 150g-200g protein, and the remainder being fat ~90g assuming the high end of protein spectrum.


Allow myself to indulge on occasion but on a daily basis no sugar, no beer, and no starchy carbs (mostly bread pasta etc.).  Wine and spirits okay on weekends but not to excess as I make terrible dieting decisions when inebriated...



Calculation:

3300 kCal - 2000 kCal = 1300 kCal deficit per day

1300 * 7 = 9100 kCal deficit per week

9100/3600 = ~2.5lbs per week



About 16 weeks to get back to a relatively healthy weight and  reevaluate from there.

936,"Is it possible to lose 10 pounds and keep it off, forever?","The title says it all. No need to read another word if you don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been in this position before. 

I used to be super active, in mega high stress job, and I had intestinal parasites, all of which kept me underweight, and unable to gain any. (I didn't know about the parasites, I thought it was just genetics. I have no idea how I got them, or how long I had them, but I bet I had them most of my  life, given how much my metabolism changed since I got rid of them 4 years ago.)

Then 2 years ago, I traded that shitty job for a totally sedentary one- and it gets worse. 

I didn't know I should change my eating habits. I used to be ravenously hungry all the time, so I ate what/when ever I felt like it.  Life was fun! And that was how I was used to living. I thought I could still eat whatever/ whenever. Nope.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing fits me anymore. I am double the pants size I've been my entire teen/ adult life, which freaks me out. And, I'm 10 pounds overweight, according to how I look &amp; feel &amp; according to height/ weight charts. (Well... actually they say I'm 2 pounds overweight, but losing 10 will put me right in the middle of healthy weight for my height, so that's what I want. I feel like I look fat.)

&amp;#x200B;

So. Is losing 10 pounds and never gaining it back a real phenomenon? I've heard people say it's incredibly hard to lose 10 pounds. Is it? I don't care how long it takes; obviously it took me 4 years to gain 30 pounds, so I know weight changes aren't a fast thing, and I don't mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

How hard is it to keep it off ?I 've never known anyone who went on a diet, lost weight, then stayed that goal weight the rest of their lives, do you know anyone that has? Are there any real 'diet success stories'? 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I actually go on a ""diet"", or start counting calories, or will just eating healthy from now on be good enough?

&amp;#x200B;

My apt complex has a weight room I feel like I should get that place figured out &amp; start using it. Should I set some kind of goal, like so many minutes, or so many times a week?

&amp;#x200B;

937,Chewing Without Swallowing,"In general, I'm not having too much problem following my keto diet. I love most of the food I can eat on it, so I don't terribly miss most of the food I can't. However, there are a couple of foods that I crave so much (like super buttery mashed potatoes that really can't be replaced with things like CAULIFLOWER, ugh) and, due to the nature of keto, I can't ""cheat"" on this diet once in awhile. However, I did wonder, if I allow myself to have my favorite treats maybe once a week (so as not to be too wasteful and not to make my body confused) as long as I don't actually swallow after chewing, I wouldn't actually ingest/digest the food and can still enjoy the taste as a small treat.

938,Need to lose fat and get lean,"Hello reddit,

Some serious things have come up in my life to the point where I need to lose weight. I’m not morbidly obese or anything. You’ll see why in just a sec though. So as a little bit of a back story, my grandpa was diagnosed with diabetes and he eventually passed away from this. My father was diagnosed when he was 14 and we believe this was a big factor in him passing a few years ago at 40. So I have a very high chance of getting diabetes. This scares me just because the simple fact of my father passing so soon. I really would like some help on what to do. I work 3rd shift a local factory so time is kinda a hard thing to come by cause I also go to college but I have set up a workout plan I’m going to start either next week or the week after. I work 10pm-6:30 am. No matter how tired I am at work as soon as I leave I’m wide awake. So I figure this would be the perfect time to just go to the gym. So here’s the schedule 
Sunday-any time I want. 
Monday- after work
Tuesday- day off
Wednesday- after work 
Thursday - after work. 
Friday-after work 
Saturday-day off
Basically though I really need help with eating. No one in my household eats right and My family is moving to Tennessee within the next few months and I have significant other here and we’ve been together for years but I actually love it here so I’m staying.
I’m 19

947,Looking for advice,"I started a diet back in April of last year and up until now (8 months) I've lost 10 kg (22 lbs). My goal was to lose 15 kg  (33 lbs) but back in november I had to eat more because my work schedule was more demanding and I needed a lot of energy.

This lead me to just trying to stay at my current weight and try not to gain any, that has been going fine but as December arrived and the holidays I wasn't as careful with what I was eating. 

My schedule makes it that March and April will be like November (meaning I'll have to eat more because I'll need more energy).

Should I try and keep my current weight steady and then have a more strict diet when I can? Or should I hold on? I know plateaus are a thing but this is my longest one. My goal is to lose another 15 kg for September so then it's fine if I take on a few kilos (also changed my first goal to 5 kg more than what I had planned).

948,Catholic lent,"For the Catholic lent, not calling myself Catholic but I think the period is well chosen I was planning on a lent from 11 March (my start) to 11 April (my stop).

[http://www.episcopalnet.org/TRACTS/fasting.html](http://www.episcopalnet.org/TRACTS/fasting.html) 

My goal is cleaning, without too much weight loss and capability to build muscle during the period.

Normally I eat no starches, but I was considering a Daniel Fast, limitation to a diet of brown rice, with lentils prepared in a vegetable broth with some fat (e.g. olive/coconut oil), with some added vitamins, salt, magnesium and potassium, maybe apple cider vinegar.

From last year: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/62zbsq/the\_40\_day\_lent\_fast/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/62zbsq/the_40_day_lent_fast/)

I might add a 4 day water fast somewhere (beginning of the second half), depending on my experience and weight evolution. Probably if I have to, I will plan maximum 5 cheat days (like Sundays in the lent, but I will do it the days when it is convenient) due to social obligations.

954,Binge Eating?,"So I lost 5 stone (about 70lbs) in as many months but have hit a plateau and remained the same weight for nearly three months now. The problem is I am binging at McDonald’s in particular with about 3000+ calories at a time. This happens two or three times a week.

Other than that, my diet consists of protein shakes, lots of fruit and veg and sources of protein such as tuna or chicken. I also drink zero calorie energy drinks and zero calorie soda which is addictive and hard to give up. 

Is there any recommendations you can make? 

Unfortunately I take a small dose of Quetiapine (Seroquel) at night which triggers intense hunger despite having already eaten. This is unlikely to change any time soon but didn’t stop me before so despite difficulty, shouldn’t stop me again.

960,"Need diet advice and ideas to avoid several obstacles. Also, I’m a horrible cook.","So I know that most of the battle of losing weight/staying healthy is what we eat. I am trying to start eating better to lose weight, but have several things that make it difficult for me to eat healthy and have options. I am looking for advice and ideas on options. 

The following are things that often make it difficult for me:

1. I cannot cook. I have little to no skill with cooking. I can use an oven, microwave, or skillet. That’s about it. 

2. I don’t know recipes/options. I have tried walking around grocery stores to look for ideas, but I’m not that well versed in what to look for. 

3. I’m dependent upon variety. I get off track/bored very easily with food if I eat the same thing too often. 

4. I have a snacking issue. I find myself eating at random all of the time. When I’m bored, having a bad day, tryin to focus while I work, etc. I am already working on cutting down on how often I snack, but I need helping finding healthy snacks that are worth it. 

5. I don’t have a lot of time during the week to devote to meal prep. A LOT of my job comes home with me each day, and so meal prepping multiple times during the week can be hard. I have tried the whole meal prep for the whole week on Sunday, but by the time I get to the 4th day of food it always taste not-so-great (dry, stale, etc.). 


There are, however, some things that play into my favor: 

1. I am NOT picky when it comes to food. 

2. It is easy to not eat out at my job due to the nature of it/the daily schedule doesn’t allow for it, so I take my lunch every day. I have a mini fridge, microwave, and toaster at my disposal at work.

962,Overwhelmed and having bad thoughts before I even start.,"24/F I've been back in the gym for a few months now. I've always been the person with a great metabolism. I've only ever been overweight by about 5-10 lbs in my lifetime. I'm ready to get serious about my diet but have no clue where to start. Usually I just try to make an effort to skip a cheeseburger for a salad or swap a sprite for a water. I've never been able to plan out meals because I don't know what meals I should be eating. 

My problem is: before I go to the gym I don't eat 6hrs before because I know I will burp up and I hate it. On gym nights I find myself having the worst thoughts about food to avoid this... I end up stuck at work with no meal prepped and only fast food options thinking myself into a spiral until I finally eat McDonalds. After consuming crappy meals I sometimes have thoughts of wanting to make myself vomit. (I have never done so). Not necessarily for weight loss reasons but simply because I hate the way it makes me feel. I don't want to burp, I don't want to be slowed down at the gym etc.  This may be more of a rant than a question but if anyone has any advice on where to start on eating better and avoiding intrusive thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

989,Help to begin,"HI, I am struggling with how to begin with a diet plan. When I say diet I mean more controlling the number of calories I take in while gaining muscle and improving stamina at the gym and remaining at the same weight (69.7kg, height is 180cm).

Currently, I survive on mostly pizza and pasta, very occasionally taking meats, and my calorie intake is all over the place with some days taking as little as 1000 calories in and others just going for it and eating and eating and eating.

My problem with starting a diet is that I'm extremely picky when it comes to food, I love fruit; hate veg (**but will take if it really is a must**, except mushrooms and spring onions), despise mayonnaise, salad cream,  coleslaw, and bacon, and I'm not a huge fan of meat **although will eat if it's a must**. I'm also won't go near sauces (except tomato) or creams.

As such, I'm looking for help in making a simple and affordable diet plan that will benefit both having the stamina for the gym (usually late morning/early afternoon is when I go) while still helping with the gain after in both stamina and muscle but not something I will hate eating (anything after ""despise"" sauces and creams, mushrooms and spring onions).

I have looked online for plans but they all seem to be trying to make fancy healthy meals adding every spice and sauce under the sun in order to sound appealing, or just be made up of the stuff that are definite no's to.

I was hoping for some suggestions for workout programs that have measurable goals for strength increase, lightweight portable equipment, such as resistance bands, and relatively inexpensive. 

This is more of a side note, if this helps suggestions, I'm not looking for a six pack (I like candy). The parts of my body (male) that make me happiest when I look in the mirror are my ass and pecs, so something with squats and chest exercises would be nice.

1015,Correcting muscle imbalance that leads to recurring injury,"So a little backstory (sorry it's so long):

In 2012, I was serving in the Navy on an aircraft carrier. We were deployed, and I was working 13 hours a night (minimum), 7 nights a week for 8 months (no, I'm not exagerrating). Rarely seeing the sun and having almost no free time, and almost nothing to do when I did have free time, I needed something to blow off steam. The ship had 7 different gyms, so I started lifting. At 25 years old, this was the first time I had ever really tried weight training. I really got into it, and became especially motivated after I received a 'Dear John Letter' 6 months in and 2 months before coming home. 

The huge problem was that, being a young guy who was admittedly in it for the wrong reasons, I basically never did legs, aside from running on the treadmill for an hour, maybe a few times a week. Well, that really came back to bite me in the lower back when I was doing 360 lb shrugs on a hack squat machine. I started losing my grip, and rather than dropping the weight like I should have done, I bent over to set it down and *pop*. Massive strain, possibly a tear in my lower back on the right side (I believe it was my right spinal erector, but not positive). I went to medical and they gave me the same ol' schtick for everything: ""Take these 800 mg Motrin, ice it and drink plenty of water."" So I did, and after a few weeks I was (so I thought) back to normal.

Now I'm 33, and I have re-injured the same muscle roughly a dozen times over those 8 years, often while trying to strengthen my glutes and legs in an attempt to prevent this from happening again. I pretty much decided that deadlifts were out of the question for me. The last time it happened I had done a set of 10 squats,135 lbs, and was going for my second set. I got my shoulders under the bar and applied the slightest pressure and *pop*. That was about a year ago and I felt defeated, like it was never going to get better and I'm just stuck with this s****y lower back. I recently saw a video about Anterior Pelvic Tilt and it seemed like a good possibility that this was causing my injury. So I started trying yoga for the hips, low back and hamstrings, and started doing exercises like single-leg Ham/Glute bridges, leg lifts, hip abductions, lunges, squat jumps; all bodyweight, to be as gentle and gradual as possible and focus on form.

Yesterday I was doing pushups toward the end of my workout, and for the first time ever, I felt the left side tweak, just a little bit. Feels okay now but it scared the hell out of me, because all I was doing was bending down to do my last set of pushups. This shouldn't happen. I'm not an old man, but I'm starting to feel like my body is prematurely betraying me. I don't really know how to frame an actual question, I'm just looking for advice. Maybe I'm missing something vital.

1018,Heart rate really high when running/exercising,"Bit of context:
Age: 25 years old
Gender: Male
Weight: 81.2kg 
BMI: 26 (just overweight), fast mass is 29.3%

I need advice for my really high heart rate. It may sound silly but I’m a bit of a beginner with exercise, I did play a bit of sport while younger then took at 10 year break :p then boom I’m 24, lazy and unfit.

So I started running about 8 months ago, I have a smart watch which tells me my heart rate and I see it slowly creeping up to 190 within 3 mins of running, I didn’t realise that was high at first so I kept running the same speed and distance for probably 5 months. (I run probably 2-3 times a week).

Anyways, My 32 minute 5k went down to a 30 minute 5k over a period of 8 months so I didn’t really improve much. I did slow down eventually and pace myself a bit better so that it would hit max 185 but anything lower then that I basically have to walk fast.

To top it off I was getting really bad shin splints for a while, went to a physio, did some exercises and slowed my pace down, it went away, came back. I couldn’t really go further then 5k without being exhausted or my legs really burning. I was recommended to work out my core.

Now my core is weaakk af, I can only plank for 20 seconds before I end up in a heap on the floor. My weight is a little on the high side. So I started doing the F45 challenge to improve my overall weight and fitness as well as diet. (For those of you don’t know what an F45 challenge is, it’s basically an 8 week challenge with 45 mins of high intensity workouts a number of times a week while eating a healthy protein, veggie rich diet in order to lose weight and gain muscle). 

I’m in week 2 at the moment, really struggling with the workouts. Again within 5 mins my heart rate jumps to 190+ doing basic exercises like pushups and squats. I end up having to stop so many times the trainer is always concerned, it’s also a little embarrassing.

Any advice to push this heart rate down would really help.

1023,Benefits/risk of pushups with different shoulder positions.,"I am a climber and a beginning personal trainer and throughout my workouts i noticed an issue with holding my shoulder positions while climbing/lifting. I have been working on scapilar push/pull ups but ibwas looking for a new progression.

Being into calisthenics, i have noticed that for several movements (L sit, planche, levers etc.) Tend to have different optimal shoulder positions that I still have trouble holding despite these scapular exercises being added to my routine.

I know that during a pushup for optimal effectiveness and safety, your shoulders should be depressed and reteacted, but i noticed ehile working towards a planche that I struggle with extending my arms fully in the planche's elevated, protracted shoulder position. 

So i started doing incline pushups with that shoulder position, really focusing on slow, steady-form reps, and let me tell you, I felt this exercise more than ive felt any other new exercise ive added in a long time. No pain, but really really strong activation signals, or so it seems at least. 

Since myself and my clients are climbers, we often find ourselves in unorthodox, unstable, and sub-optimal body positions. Im wondering if doing pushups with different shoulder positions (performed by advanced clients, with this specific goal of building shoulder stability in all areas of the shoulder) is a justified risk.

I'm aware that shoulders should be ret and dep fore safety purposes, but is it worth it to pursue these exercises further? Can it even possibly reduce risk of injury for people like climbers during their sport?



TLDR: Climber looking to improve shoulder 
stability. While generally unsafe for beginners, can an advanced client see benefits from performing pushups in all variants of shoulder positioning, and CAN IT be safe if done PROPERLY?

Also this might be in the Wrong place but in all fairness this topic is a question about variations and form of an exercise.",1,benefits risk pushups different shoulder positions,climber beginning personal trainer throughout workouts noticed issue holding shoulder positions climbing lifting working scapilar push pull ups ibwas looking new progression calisthenics noticed several movements l sit planche levers etc tend different optimal shoulder positions still trouble holding despite scapular exercises added routine know pushup optimal effectiveness safety shoulders depressed reteacted noticed ehile working towards planche struggle extending arms fully planche elevated protracted shoulder position started incline pushups shoulder position really focusing slow steady form reps let tell felt exercise ive felt new exercise ive added long time pain really really strong activation signals seems least since clients climbers often find unorthodox unstable sub optimal body positions im wondering pushups different shoulder positions performed advanced clients specific goal building shoulder stability areas shoulder justified risk aware shoulders ret dep fore safety purposes worth pursue exercises even possibly reduce risk injury people like climbers sport tldr climber looking improve shoulder stability generally unsafe beginners advanced client see benefits performing pushups variants shoulder positioning safe done properly also might wrong place fairness topic question variations form exercise,benefit risk pushup different shoulder position ,climber beginning personal trainer throughout workout noticed issue holding shoulder position climbing lifting working scapilar push pull ups ibwas looking new progression calisthenics noticed several movement l sit planche lever etc tend different optimal shoulder position still trouble holding despite scapular exercise added routine know pushup optimal effectiveness safety shoulder depressed reteacted noticed ehile working towards planche struggle extending arm fully planche elevated protracted shoulder position started incline pushup shoulder position really focusing slow steady form rep let tell felt exercise ive felt new exercise ive added long time pain really really strong activation signal seems least since client climber often find unorthodox unstable sub optimal body position im wondering pushup different shoulder position performed advanced client specific goal building shoulder stability area shoulder justified risk aware shoulder ret dep fore safety purpose worth pursue exercise even possibly reduce risk injury people like climber sport tldr climber looking improve shoulder stability generally unsafe beginner advanced client see benefit performing pushup variant shoulder positioning safe done properly also might wrong place fairness topic question variation form exercise ,benefit risk pushup differ shoulder posit ,climber begin person trainer throughout workout notic issu hold shoulder posit climb lift work scapilar push pull up ibwa look new progress calisthen notic sever movement l sit planch lever etc tend differ optim shoulder posit still troubl hold despit scapular exercis ad routin know pushup optim effect safeti shoulder depress reteact notic ehil work toward planch struggl extend arm fulli planch elev protract shoulder posit start inclin pushup shoulder posit realli focus slow steadi form rep let tell felt exercis ive felt new exercis ive ad long time pain realli realli strong activ signal seem least sinc client climber often find unorthodox unstabl sub optim bodi posit im wonder pushup differ shoulder posit perform advanc client specif goal build shoulder stabil area shoulder justifi risk awar shoulder ret dep fore safeti purpos worth pursu exercis even possibl reduc risk injuri peopl like climber sport tldr climber look improv shoulder stabil gener unsaf beginn advanc client see benefit perform pushup variant shoulder posit safe done properli also might wrong place fair topic question variat form exercis

1036,Cannot Seem to get Muscular Hypertrophy,"Hi r/Exercise,

I was wondering if there is a way to maximize gains (muscular hypertrophy) by doing free weights at a predetermined RSI, where RSI:=(mass lifted • repetitions)/(body mass).

I have increased my baseline lift mass by 10 lbs, but I still feel as if I’m not making any progress. I see guys who lift less than I do with a higher degree of muscular hypertrophy. I can’t handle whey based protein (even isolates) because my body doesn’t make lactase. Would brown rice protein be optimal?

For reference, I use 30lb weights for hammer curls, overhead dumbbell presses, and dumbbell chest presses (I started at 20lb). I do 2-3 sets of 6-8 reps approximately 3 times a week for about 3 months (had to take 2 weeks off because I got influenza).

I would like some general pointers as to what I’m doing wrong.

Thanks for any help.

1055,How do I start exercising steadily? I’m so sore I give up.,"I’ve changed my diet and lost 4 lbs on that alone in the past month. I’m 5’6” and 136 lbs, so I’m at a healthy weight, but I want to continue making healthier choices. I’m definitely way out of shape; I’m pretty sure the only reason I’m thin is due to my metabolism. 

Part of making better choices is adding 30 minutes of exercise a day, right? I’ve never done that before in my life. I started out with normal exercises like 30 jumping jacks, 10 push-ups, a short jog, 10 burpees, etc to fill up the thirty minutes. My goal wasn’t to target anything, just to get my blood moving and burn some calories. 

I’ve tried to do exercises listed above about three separate occasions now and every time my body HURTS so bad the next day I can’t possibly exercise again. This severe soreness stays about 3 days and then goes away. Obviously I need more than an hr of exercise a week so I’m at a loss on what I can do. 

I’ve tried stretching beforehand. I have sufficient protein in my diet. I drink at least 60 ounces of water a day. I’ve tried baths with epsom salt after work outs. Nothing helps :(. What can I do? 

TL;DR: Exercise makes my body sore for three days. I have enough protein, drink plenty of water, stretch before workouts, only stick to 30 minutes of exercise with small breaks in between activities, and I’ve tried a bath with epsom salt to calm my muscles. Nothing helps at all. The soreness is so severe I can barely stand to touch the muscles the next day.

1060,I train way better when I'm hungry/fasted,"Can anybody shed any light on this? Whenever I do cardio-based stuff like running or CrossFit, I perform waaaaay better when I'm either fasted (train first thing in the morning before breakfast) or really hungry (train in the evening when I haven't eaten since lunch). It seems so counter-intuitive since we use glycogen for energy. And the difference is BIG! Like it's  the difference between running 8km before I need a break vs. 5km before I need a break. 

And I'm not comparing it to training after having just eaten (where you would obviously feel bloated and gross).

My goal was to exercise 6 days per week, but I did so only on 5 days. I'm not discouraged, though, because without the goal I set for myself, I probably would have exercised only 4 times, or less. 1 extra day is still good.

I also spoke to my physiotherapist about coming up with modifications for 1 of my exercises, because the one was seriously tiring me out, to the point where it reduced my motivation and even ability to do the others. (Challenge = Good. Exhaustion = Not So Good.) So, I'm still feeling super motivated to rock this challenge! Only 11 weeks to a new and improved me!

How about you? You feeling motivated to rock this? :)

Oh, and I also need to integrate stretches, 3 times a day, to counteract spasticity (when the muscles tense up on their own, for no good reason).

(I wasn't sure whether to put this with exercising or with otome games. So I guess I'll just pick this subreddit since you'll probably better be able to answer my question)

So a month or so ago I started the otome visual novel app Burn Your Fat With Me and I've enjoyed it. I really like the creative immersion of physically doing something that effects the game. Anyway recently I was strongly advised to stop doing sit ups since it can cause back pain and I have a pretty funky body. The main exercise used for the main story of the game is sit ups. I've tried doing squats or something instead but I do kinda miss the original arrangement I had.

I was wondering if anybody knows of any good exercises that do a similar thing as sit ups that I could use in place of them for a closer experience to the intended exercise for the game but without the back pain and other negative attributes of sit ups.",1,good alternative situps,sorry posting deleting reposting apparently edit titles realized needed make clearer question asked sure whether put exercising otome games guess pick subreddit since probably better able answer question month ago started otome visual novel app burn fat enjoyed really like creative immersion physically something effects game anyway recently strongly advised stop sit ups since cause back pain pretty funky body main exercise used main story game sit ups tried squats something instead kinda miss original arrangement wondering anybody knows good exercises similar thing sit ups could use place closer experience intended exercise game without back pain negative attributes sit ups,good alternative situps ,sorry posting deleting reposting apparently edit title realized needed make clearer question asked sure whether put exercising otome game guess pick subreddit since probably better able answer question month ago started otome visual novel app burn fat enjoyed really like creative immersion physically something effect game anyway recently strongly advised stop sit ups since cause back pain pretty funky body main exercise used main story game sit ups tried squat something instead kinda miss original arrangement wondering anybody know good exercise similar thing sit ups could use place closer experience intended exercise game without back pain negative attribute sit ups ,good altern situp ,sorri post delet repost appar edit titl realiz need make clearer question ask sure whether put exercis otom game guess pick subreddit sinc probabl better abl answer question month ago start otom visual novel app burn fat enjoy realli like creativ immers physic someth effect game anyway recent strongli advis stop sit up sinc caus back pain pretti funki bodi main exercis use main stori game sit up tri squat someth instead kinda miss origin arrang wonder anybodi know good exercis similar thing sit up could use place closer experi intend exercis game without back pain neg attribut sit up

I don't have a gym membership (can't afford it) but I do have a yoga mat, so I wanted to start doing push ups and planks to build upper body strength.

1091,The day I learnt to exercise for myself and not for social media,"I've recently learnt that I was putting way too much emphasis on showing off my exercise over actually doing the exercise! It's not so bad to track what you're doing, but I'd go for a run and instead of praising myself the whole run I'd be thinking about the facebook post I would write afterwards, or how I was going to impress other people. When I should have been thinking about why I was there in the first place. 
I would also feel disappointed if I couldn't run as far as I would like because I couldn't 'show off' the distance. 

So today... I just went for a run. No overthinking, no showing off, no thinking about anything but one foot in front of the other. A plain and simple... run. 

I started to think about why I was running in the first place. Mental health, relaxation, exercise, fitness. And when my breath became too quick I was able to think about my breath, in, out, in, out. It meant I could run further, enjoy it more and above all run for the run.

Yes I tracked it... but for my own benefit. Not for sharing. And I didn't share with anyone but me.

Thought I'd share my experience :)",1,day learnt exercise social media,recently learnt putting way much emphasis showing exercise actually exercise bad track go run instead praising whole run thinking facebook post would write afterwards going impress people thinking first place would also feel disappointed run far would like show distance today went run overthinking showing thinking anything one foot front plain simple run started think running first place mental health relaxation exercise fitness breath became quick able think breath meant could run enjoy run run yes tracked benefit sharing share anyone thought share experience,day learnt exercise social medium ,recently learnt putting way much emphasis showing exercise actually exercise bad track go run instead praising whole run thinking facebook post would write afterwards going impress people thinking first place would also feel disappointed run far would like show distance today went run overthinking showing thinking anything one foot front plain simple run started think running first place mental health relaxation exercise fitness breath became quick able think breath meant could run enjoy run run yes tracked benefit sharing share anyone thought share experience ,day learnt exercis social media ,recent learnt put way much emphasi show exercis actual exercis bad track go run instead prais whole run think facebook post would write afterward go impress peopl think first place would also feel disappoint run far would like show distanc today went run overthink show think anyth one foot front plain simpl run start think run first place mental health relax exercis fit breath becam quick abl think breath meant could run enjoy run run ye track benefit share share anyon thought share experi

1106,Swimming is so much more effective than running.,"I don’t deny that running has a lot of benefits: 

You can burn hundreds of calories running five miles and burn off the fat while building your leg muscles. 

However, running takes a big toll on your body especially on your knees and joints. 

That’s why I recommend swimming over running. 

Why? 

(1) more muscles worked

Swimming works out more muscles than does running. Running primarily targets your leg muscles and a few arm muscles. However, swimming targets muscles throughout the body ranging from your shoulders to your chest to your obliques all the way to your quads. 

Swimming a lot can make you look more buff especially on your upper body than running will. 

(2) you can swim a lot more without the fear of injuring your body 

50 laps of 25 meters burns about 500 calories give or take some depending on your weight and metabolism. To achieve the same calories burned in running you would have to run about 5 miles. Yet, you can swim this much and the worst injuries you might get are pulled muscles or a tear in shoulder muscle. With running on the other hand, you put yourself at risk for torn muscles, injuries to your joints, injured knees, sprained ankles, plantar fasciitis, and the list just goes on and on. 

(3) swimming makes you more flexible than running can

Swimming aids the range of motion especially for the torso, shoulder, and hips. Running can’t do the same. 
 
This can aid you even if you are participating in other sports such as football or basketball. Seahawks qb Russell Wilson swims a lot in the offseason to help aid his durability. He also hasn’t had any major injuries in a sport notorious for them.",1,swimming much effective running,deny running lot benefits burn hundreds calories running five miles burn fat building leg muscles however running takes big toll body especially knees joints recommend swimming running 1 muscles worked swimming works muscles running running primarily targets leg muscles arm muscles however swimming targets muscles throughout body ranging shoulders chest obliques way quads swimming lot make look buff especially upper body running 2 swim lot without fear injuring body 50 laps 25 meters burns 500 calories give take depending weight metabolism achieve calories burned running would run 5 miles yet swim much worst injuries might get pulled muscles tear shoulder muscle running hand put risk torn muscles injuries joints injured knees sprained ankles plantar fasciitis list goes 3 swimming makes flexible running swimming aids range motion especially torso shoulder hips running aid even participating sports football basketball seahawks qb russell wilson swims lot offseason help aid durability also major injuries sport notorious,swimming much effective running ,deny running lot benefit burn hundred calorie running five mile burn fat building leg muscle however running take big toll body especially knee joint recommend swimming running 1 muscle worked swimming work muscle running running primarily target leg muscle arm muscle however swimming target muscle throughout body ranging shoulder chest oblique way quad swimming lot make look buff especially upper body running 2 swim lot without fear injuring body 50 lap 25 meter burn 500 calorie give take depending weight metabolism achieve calorie burned running would run 5 mile yet swim much worst injury might get pulled muscle tear shoulder muscle running hand put risk torn muscle injury joint injured knee sprained ankle plantar fasciitis list go 3 swimming make flexible running swimming aid range motion especially torso shoulder hip running aid even participating sport football basketball seahawks qb russell wilson swim lot offseason help aid durability also major injury sport notorious ,swim much effect run ,deni run lot benefit burn hundr calori run five mile burn fat build leg muscl howev run take big toll bodi especi knee joint recommend swim run 1 muscl work swim work muscl run run primarili target leg muscl arm muscl howev swim target muscl throughout bodi rang shoulder chest obliqu way quad swim lot make look buff especi upper bodi run 2 swim lot without fear injur bodi 50 lap 25 meter burn 500 calori give take depend weight metabol achiev calori burn run would run 5 mile yet swim much worst injuri might get pull muscl tear shoulder muscl run hand put risk torn muscl injuri joint injur knee sprain ankl plantar fasciiti list goe 3 swim make flexibl run swim aid rang motion especi torso shoulder hip run aid even particip sport footbal basketbal seahawk qb russel wilson swim lot offseason help aid durabl also major injuri sport notori

1112,One specific exercise and why these are the results?,"Hello. Wanted to share a new exercise that Ive heard about and implemented today.

It's basically for the upper back and neck to have a better alignment of the body.

You stand with your heels, ass, upper back and back of the hesd touching the wall, hands next to the thighs. From this position raise arms while holding them straight up until they touch the wall. While doing so, don't let your back arch.

Harder modification is to sit with your legs straight while doing so. Same action.

Last, hardest modification is to bend your knees so that not just lower back is disconnected by sitting but also legs. Do the same action. Suggested amount was 50 times per one modification.

However! My experience was interesting. I was able to hit upper back, shoulders and arms were working also but interestingly, my right mid-lower back was also exercising while doing so meanwhile the left side didn't feel the load at all.

And my observation is that my right side of the back is more tense and is bigger (as if the muscle is bigger).

But that raises a question to me- does that mean that back left side is weaker or the right side is weaker? And how do I test that?",1,one specific exercise results,hello wanted share new exercise ive heard implemented today basically upper back neck better alignment body stand heels ass upper back back hesd touching wall hands next thighs position raise arms holding straight touch wall let back arch harder modification sit legs straight action last hardest modification bend knees lower back disconnected sitting also legs action suggested amount 50 times per one modification however experience interesting able hit upper back shoulders arms working also interestingly right mid lower back also exercising meanwhile left side feel load observation right side back tense bigger muscle bigger raises question mean back left side weaker right side weaker test,one specific exercise result ,hello wanted share new exercise ive heard implemented today basically upper back neck better alignment body stand heel as upper back back hesd touching wall hand next thigh position raise arm holding straight touch wall let back arch harder modification sit leg straight action last hardest modification bend knee lower back disconnected sitting also leg action suggested amount 50 time per one modification however experience interesting able hit upper back shoulder arm working also interestingly right mid lower back also exercising meanwhile left side feel load observation right side back tense bigger muscle bigger raise question mean back left side weaker right side weaker test ,one specif exercis result ,hello want share new exercis ive heard implement today basic upper back neck better align bodi stand heel ass upper back back hesd touch wall hand next thigh posit rais arm hold straight touch wall let back arch harder modif sit leg straight action last hardest modif bend knee lower back disconnect sit also leg action suggest amount 50 time per one modif howev experi interest abl hit upper back shoulder arm work also interestingli right mid lower back also exercis meanwhil left side feel load observ right side back tens bigger muscl bigger rais question mean back left side weaker right side weaker test

1131,3 days a week cardio and weights,"Hello, looking for advice.  

Due to my schedule I need to keep my workouts to 3 or 4 days per week.  Also, due to my various join issues, I can not readily combine cardio activity with muscle building activity.  

Currently I am weight lifting 3 days per week: Wed: full body.  Saturday: push, Sunday: pull.  

I would like to add cardio,  due to my joint issues, HIIT is pretty much out.   I was thinking I would do 30 minutes of service 70%-80% cardio after my weight lifting session each day.

Is this going to be too much all at once?  Obviously doing a pretty tough cardio session after a  pretty tough weight session will negatively impact both to some degree.  I am not out to win any weightlifting or bodybuilding competitions so that seems okay.   Total workout time would be about 90-120 minutes 3x per week.  

Any input appreciated!

Anyway, I started to think that if i were to be another person, i wouldnt choose myself to date with looking at my physical appearance. Hence to sum it up, i decided to do some simple exercise in my small apartment.

Question: since i dont really do fitness and muscle building, what kind of simple exercise can i do? Situps and pushups perhaps? Or maybe do some stretches and try to do the split? How much exercise do i need to do each day and do i need a break every once in a while?

1174,Could fast walking for 1 hour really burn 400 calories?,"I've used a number of online calorie burning calculators including my most trusted one (myfitnesspal) and they all suggest that 1 hour and 10 minutes of fast walking (about 4.3 miles) burns around 390 calories.

I've let myself go due to the stress of college (just graduated), starting a new full-time job, depression, and losing my thyroid to radioactive iodine but I'm tired of excuses and I really want to find a sustainable daily routine. I used to mainly do weights, but now I don't have a gym (I could get a membership but I want to commit to some form of exercise first). I used to run every now and then but my doctor thinks that I somehow developed a chronic exercise induced compartment syndrome, which, if you don't know what that means, is where my muscles contract to the point that blood can't flow properly in my leg. My leg becomes hard, and very painful. I was never formally diagnosed, so it could be something else (which would make sense, since this disorder is typically found in hardcore athletes). I'd like to be able to run, it's a great exercise and I don't need a gym to do it. But per my doctor, he thinks only low impact exercises are good. I don't know if there is something I can do to make running possible again... Other than that, I was a competitive swimmer in middle school and high school and I would not mind swimming (other than hating my swim suit bod lol), but I'd need a gym membership for that. Do you guys have any advise for adding exercise into my life before I get a membership? I know that if I don't add it on before, I won't go to the gym.

1196,"Belly fat and 0 flexibility, no real exercise for almost a decade, how to start","Hey there

In this last year I changed my eating habits and lost 7 kilos. So now I weight 78kg, and I'm 1.75cm. I'm not fat but have some extra meat, but the problem is the belly(which all started many years ago).  I hate that gut sticking out. I've seen fatter people with no gut. So anyway, lately I've been going on some walks, mornings or nights. Thing is, I also need something that kills the calories a bit quicker but also gives me flexibility little by little because right now I can barely reach down my knees with my hands, let alone my feet.

Given my complete rusty body and belly fat(little now but still sticking) what kind of flexibility exercises should I do daily? Note, I know the best way to kill the belly fat is probably by running(I'm guessing, I could be wrong) but my lack of flexibility is scaring, I want to take care of this quickly as I'm 32 years old.

1224,Ectomorphs who gained weight,"Any ectomorphs on here successfully put on weight? For context, I’m male 26, 5’7”, 121 lbs. 

    A few weeks ago I made the decision to start working out with the goal of gaining hopefully 15-20 lbs in the long run. I started tracking my calories, calculated my BMR and added 500 calories per day. I also bought a fitness watch so I would have an idea of how many calories I was burning per day, and it links to my calorie tracking app and deducts those calories automatically from what I’ve consumed already. I bought two protein powders. One the typical whey with more protein than anything else, and the second is a gainer for those days where I hadn’t quite met my calorie needs for the day. 

    I’ve mainly been doing some dumbbell workouts at home, I don’t want to go to barbell exercises until I feel I’ve got my posture under control so that I don’t hurt myself trying to lift too heavy before I’m ready.

   Fast forward to this morning, I haven’t weighed myself in nearly a week and a half because I know weighing yourself too often will throw you off more than anything. I step on the scale and see that I’ve actually lost 2 lbs. this was extremely disappointing, and put me in a down mood all day. For clarity I am a very active person, I work a trades job, live on a small hobby farm, constantly lifting things, probably walk anywhere from 8-15 kms per day. I have little to no bodyfat, so I know that most likely the weight I’ve lost has been muscle mass.

   Have any ectomorphs successfully gained weight? How did you do it? Should I add another 500 calories to my daily intake?

1237,Exercise and Diet Help,"Guys I'm pretty new to exercising but have decided it's time. I have a lot of basic questions but want to  make sure that I'm being as effective as pot with my regiment.

For starters, I'm a 26 year male, 6ft tall and currently weight 187lbs. Last check with the gym staff I had 15.6% body fat.

I've started going to the gym and go three days a week currently.

My ideal goal is lose weight and gain muscle. I understand this is somewhat impossible so I'd say my main focus is losing weight but adding muscle definition.

With that said, what should my diet consist of? Is this a strictly Chicken and Rice scenario? How much water should I be consuming?

My days at the gym are mainly focused on specific muscle groups and I wrap up each session with 10 minutes of cardio.

My biggest problem I think is my diet.

**First** thing you need to do is to start watching your diet. Reduce your intake of diary products (cheese, cappuccinos, milk) and bread products as well, because this tends to give you less shaped arms.

1254,Recurring Calf Muscle Strain/Tear While Running,"Two months ago while jogging, about a half mile in, I felt an ""unzipping"" in my calf muscle, followed by moderate pain, enough that I stopped and walked home. I figured I tore it or strained it (maybe those are the same thing?)

In the meantime, while healing, I've been riding my bike, 10-12 miles at a pop, three times a week or so. 

After two months I figured I had surely healed enough so I decided to go for a run today. About 3/4 of a mile in, the same spot, same muscle, started progressively hurting more with each step. No unzip this time, but after maybe a dozen strides, the pain level was similar. So I walked home again. 

Now I'm limping pretty good with moderate discomfort. 

What am I doing wrong? What should I do differently?

At the moment I stretch before starting my run, but that's it. Calfs, quads, hamstrings, etc. Any advice to put an end to this foolishness would help.

1264,"I (31, F, 157cm, 63kg) have trouble losing weight, hitting protein goal on deficit","UPDATE: I seem to have broken the plateau by having a day a week with considerably fewer calories, and now averaging out lower than before. :) Down to 61.5kg with this week's average.

&amp;#x200B;

So  I'm currently trying to lose a few kg of bodyfat (BF currently at about  35%) as I'm slightly overweight and my BF is too high (needs to be  under 33% for my gender and age range). I've been eating at about  1,500cal per day for almost five weeks now (TDEE estimated at about  1,950cal), work out at my gym (strength training on machines and with  dumbbells, whole-body routine taking about an hour ten plus warm-up) two  to three times a week, and have started adding some bodyweight  exercises in on my off days a week ago. So far, I've only lost about a  kg (which seems to be mostly BF, though) although I was hoping for  closer to half a kg per week (which would be about 2.5kg by now), and  it's been almost stagnating for two weeks now.

I'm  progressing with my strength training, and have lost some waist  circumference, but I'm still kind of disappointed with my weight loss/BF  loss so far.

Also, at only  1,500cal daily, I'm struggling with hitting my protein goal for the day  (126g).

Now, I sleep less and I'm more focused and have more energy than when I was sleeping 9 hours. Incredible!

1278,Working out in hot place... am I harming myself?,"Hello,

I am a 22 year old male.

I am relatively fit but not athletic.

I have mitral valve prolapse but no other problems with my heart. I am however, quite anxious with things that have to do with it.

I am doing krav maga and as the weather is hot I feel very tired sometimes. sessions are 1.5 hours long and contain many explosive exercises e.g jumping as high as you can or doing burpees. For the last months I feel very tired when working out. 1-2 times I was not well hydrated and started feeling exhausted ( I felt like I was prone to fainting if I continuted). I generally drink 1.5 liters of water during sessions and I'm still thirsty. Exercise takes place in a room without A/C. The temperature there is like 28 C. Humidity outside is said to be like 50% but I believe inside the room will be more as there are many people sweating. I have noticed my heart rate going to points I believe are too high (166 20 seconds after stoping exercise so I believe it should be \~ 185 when exercising).

Do you think it is safe doing such a workout under these conditions?  
Am I putting unnecessary strain on my heart?

1355,What happens when I skip certain moves?,"I’m a female, who’s been working out for a while now. Tbh I’m not very athletic and I’d been overweight until about 2 years ago when I decided to lose pounds to become however I look like right now; and to explain that, I look quite normal, thin around the waist and generally alright, but since I‘ve lost pounds by only dieting and not exercising back then, I’m not really tight and my legs are thicker than any other part of my body and I’ve got some belly fat either so, that’s how I decided to work out. I mean, nothing’s “that” unsatisfying for me about how I look but why not better? (To explain it with numbers, my height: 167 cm and my weight: 56 kg.)

But the thing is, I’m not really athletic and pretty much the only sports I’ve been into until this moment was ping pong so, I just can’t find the motivation to work out. I work out 3 days at most and when I do, I tend to skip some moves. In fact, I decide I’ll skip moves even before leaving the house to go to the gym so that it gives me the motivation to go there, makes me feel like it isn’t that hard. So that’s kind of my solution; skip some moves, or don’t work out at all. 
(I’m an ambitious person about everything else, but I really dislike working out. I’d put it to top 5 things I strongly dislike doing. It makes the process a whole lot harder.)

But the thing is, does skipping those moves make the whole process useless?

My moves are mostly focused on legs so it generally goes like; Trx squat (I generally skip this), leg press, squat DB shoulder press, lying leg curl, hip thrust (Skip), kettle bell swing, adduction


These are the main moves,
And additional to those, one day I do these:
seated row, cable curl, sit up


And the other day, these:
DB lateral raises, triceps push down (skip), leg raises

I was never a super active kid (I didn’t do sports but enjoyed running so it’s not like I didn’t do anything) and when I went into my teens well I just got worse I guess, mainly because I was super skinny and idk I just thought I didn’t need it... but now I am older and my body is definitely not the same, I weight 130 lbs and my height is around 5’3” and the reason why I started going to the gym is because my arms are getting a lot fatter and I have a bit of a belly, I know to most people I don’t look fat but I am so out of shape that it brings me to my real problem here...

I can’t do a push up even if my life depended on it and I would really appreciate if anyone has any advice on how to build that core strength, what could I do for my chest, because even when i do it in my knees it’s too difficult and some people at the gym have pointed that the way I tend to compensate could end up hurting my back when I try to go back up (which is a big NO as I suffered from scoliosis when I was a kid) (ps. I did physical therapy for the scoliosis and the doctors said I was fine)

1421,Anyone here have exercise induce athsma? And/or swim for exercise?,"Hi! First time poster here. I think I may need some encouragement and some advice because I’m getting frustrated here.

First off, I SUCK at sports. I’ve always tried, but I was always out of breath to the point of being in pain. Turns out (I just found this out a few months ago) I have exercise induced asthma  and all this time I thought it was because I was so out of shape. I decided to talk to a doctor after about 7 months of doing kickboxing self defense classes and the pain just stopped me from going on. It also made me dizzy and I missed out on concentrating on directions. I was breaking out in tears it was so bad. Chest pain, coughing and wheezing, I saw the doctor and he gave me an inhaler to take before exercise.

I tried it for the first time before going to run on the treadmill at the gym.  So I started running, and I kept running...and running! It didn’t hurt! I was smiling from ear to ear! I was SO excited! If only I had known sooner, I could have had a much healthier life.  However, I was eventually gasping for air, but I was just happy I wasn’t in pain anymore.

So I still take the inhaler before exercise, but I still have trouble breathing and am short of breath. However, the pain is not there anymore and neither is the wheezing or coughing. I’m trying to understand this. I called my doctor and asked if maybe I should take more of the inhaler, he just sent me prednisone and to call him back to tell him if it worked. It didn’t do anything. If it did it was minuscule. I didn’t call him back. I have the feeling he doesn’t care. I decided maybe I was just being a baby and things will get better.

4 months later and it’s still hard to breathe. I’ve become less motivated to exercise. I didn’t feel like going to kickboxing much anymore. I had to put it on freeze because money is tight because I’m getting married. I’m trying swimming now, and once again, the breathing is an issue. I have to stop every lap and catch my breath. I LOVE swimming. I want to get better at it! I just want to enjoy something and be good at it. 

Does someone have exercise induced asthma? Do you deal with the same thing? Do any of you swim and can give advice on breathing? I could use someone to talk to.

1432,"A while ago (26 days to be exact, that long? wow), I posted in here seeking help. So far I have lost 5 pounds, and I wanted to say thank you to everyone who has given me support!","So, I posted the thread [""Desperately seeking help in exercising.  I don't know where to start, or even what to do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/clgfzv/desperately_seeking_help_in_exercising_i_dont/), and I recieved so many comments helping me along, and I have to say thank you!

I have lost 5 pounds according to my scale (289!), but because the batteries are low/dead, I don't know if its accurate.  But still, it is a HUGE improvement compared to what I've been doing.

I also am starting school soon, and recently quit my job so I am able to actually get up more often, go out, and do things that I wasn't able to do, and enjoy time in the day!

Nearly every night, I've gotten off the computer when bored, and just walked.  Just to get up and out of the house.  I walk at a fast pace, enough to get my heart rate up, and able to keep that pace for a long period of time now.  When I get back, I do push ups (Use the stairs to help make them easier) 3 sets of 5, sit ups 3 sets of 10, jumping jacks as many as I can do, some strange form of squats to where it doesn't hurt my knees 3 sets of 5, and some stretching/yoga thrown in.  I also do this thing where I hand my heels off the edge of the stairs, dip down on them, then raise them up (Can't think of what its called), and do that 5X 3 times.

But most importantly, I have noticed that I'm not as tired, and in a better mood overall doing all of this, and I am eating less.  That was the worst part.  I still get ravishingly hungry and want to eat, eat, and eat, but less often now.  

I still struggle with it, and it feels like I'm not getting any stronger, but I know it takes time to get better.  I'm just hoping that I can keep this up, unlike the other times where I would start, then just give up.

1434,Newbie questions regarding muscle growth and fat burning,"As I (m, mid-20s) use a wheelchair due to my disability, I have never really done any exercise because I couldn't find any activity that doesn't require much planning that I simultaneously enjoy. After ages, I finally received a handbike a few weeks ago, and it's just awesome to be outside while doing something good for myself! Still more exhausting than it probably should be but I'm well aware that I'm only getting started.

Atm, I'm at 175cm/76kg (5'7""/167lbs) which is technically fine with me, but I definitely want to work on that muscle-to-fat ratio. Now I know that endurance-based activities such as cycling might not be the most suitable for muscle gain, but for me it's the most practical option right now, so please keep that in mind. Not saying I won't continue looking for other activities to strain my muscles more equally.

Now for my questions:  
I've never really counted my calories but I've been eating more healthily since last year. Given my goal of maintaining my weight while losing fat and gaining muscles, should I just continue eating the same while doing moderate exercise, or is eating more while also burning more calories (same net intake) any more or less beneficial?

Secondly, is subjective effort an indicator for calorie burn, i.e. does a newbie who is sweating like hell after a 15km (10mi) ride (me) burn any more calories than an experienced person over the same distance?

1454,Overtraining Symptoms: Are You A Victim?,"These days, you can't spend more than five minutes in a locker room, or read three pages in a magazine without coming across the term ""overtraining."" In a way, overtraining seems to be like sub-prime mortgages: nobody really knows what it is, but it sure is responsible for some bad things.

So today we shall analyze:

1. What constitutes overtraining.
2. If you are affected and how to fix it.
3. How to use overtraining (or better said: overreaching) to your advantage.

**What is Overtraining?**

Basically, [overtraining](https://hvmn.com/blog/training/overtraining-syndrome-can-sabotage-performance) occurs whenever the volume and intensity of someone's workouts are exceeding their ability to recover. This means progress is coming to a screeching halt, due to delayed recovery and elevated cortisol levels.

You are likely to lose mass and strength in the process. Other symptoms include irritability, lack of appetite, sleeplessness, loss of enthusiasm and motivation. Even depression is in the cards for you. You are more likely to get sick and/or injured, and your little injuries will take longer to heal.

Muscles recover within 48 hours, which is when protein synthesis rates level off. So if you experience any of the above symptoms I would recommend a 48-72 hour hiatus from the gym with a solid calorie surplus and a daily nap. Within 3 days, you should be able to return to the gym and continue on your path to eternal glory and total awesomeness.

**Cases of Severe Overtraining**

Unfortunately, not all cases of overtraining are cured so easily. If the central nervous system (CNS) is overstimulated, the recovery process will take a much longer time. In those cases, the athlete often experiences light to medium depression, loss of libido, elevated pulse rate and deep-seated fatigue.

Very often, this condition goes hand in hand with adrenal burnout (those [pre-workout](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/store/category/pre-workout.html) stims have their downsides, for sure). Here the first order of business is caffeine, yohimbine, ephedra, etc out, passionflower, melatonin, L-tyrosine and ZMA in. Also, you will need to take a whole week or 10 days from the gym.

This also includes a mental break. Try not to spend too much time at the muscle and strength website - just this once though! You can engage in other activities, just no weight training or spending time inside a gym. Additional recovery measures such as acupuncture, cryotherapy or massage can be extremely helpful during that time.

You should start taking your resting pulse rate in the morning, in order to have a baseline. Once it has dropped by five or more beats per minute, you can make an attempt to return to the gym - but you should cut your workload in half (at least for the first two weeks). From there on you can work your way back.",1,overtraining symptoms victim,days spend five minutes locker room read three pages magazine without coming across term overtraining way overtraining seems

1464,Alternative to Strength training,"Hello, I have been on a weight-loss journey for the past year or so with the help of a personal trainer(doing weight lifts).  I lost 37 pounds but there is an issue.  I keep getting injuries in different parts of my muscles because my personal trainer has been getting negligent over time(its my fault too.  I should have been more stubborn when I said the weights is too much instead of trusting him that everything would be ok).

I have now an injury that severely limits my arm movement(hopefully not forever but it may need surgery), but to me this was the last straw and I left my trainer.  After all the injuries I want to stay away from traditional weight lifting if possible(Emotionally weight lifting at the gym has such a negative association for me right now).

  I am still in recovery and not looking for medical advice, but instead wanted to ask for alternatives to strength training to build up muscle while losing weight(once I recover...in the meantime I will rest and walk when I can).  I'm not looking to be a body builder, but I would like to continue my weight loss journey while keeping my muscles in good shape to keep a healthy lifestyle.

I was thinking that maybe Strength Yoga, but honestly I have no clue.  I was wondering if I could get some advice on alternatives(Maybe lighter weights but more times per week, or exercise from a video instead of personal trainer?  I currently don't want to hire another one)?  

My workout was- 40 minute walks a day, Diet recommendations, and weight lifting 1/2 hour for 3 days a week.

I mean, that's pretty much what every gym class I've taken since middle school has taught me.

She also said that I shouldn't jog yet, and just speed walk, but idk if that would actually be as effective as jogging (and even if it is I just think I'd look silly). She gets a lot of her info from Facebook and she's into Herbalife so sometimes I take her health advice with a grain of salt, but shes been exercising for way longer than I have so I have no point of reference.

1504,Hip Flexors/Back Pain &amp; Crunches?,"I rarely do abs because some forms of crunches really kill my lower back. I usually get frustrated and call it quits. I did a little digging and I decided to treat the problem as if it was an issue with my hip flexors.

First, I started stretching my hip flexors more, thinking it was a flexibility issue, but saw no changes over a few weeks. Then, I tried strengthening them instead using a few different exercises at the end of every session, right before stretching (I did stop stretching them so much around this time). Still, the lower back pain persists.

I use the back bench occasionally (not sure what the actual name is, but it’s like a backwards crunch where you bend over at the hips and pop back up) and do deadlifts frequently to strengthen my lower back but I still see no results as far as decreased back pain.

I mostly notice the back pain when I’m doing crunches that require me to straighten my legs up off the ground (like leg raises) but also in crunches like the Russian Twist. I notice pain when I use the incline sit-up bench as well. Basically the only crunches I can do are bicycles, bent leg raises, and plain jane crunches.

I believe my form is correct and not the issue. My abs are engaged and my lower abs are pulled down to my spine to protect my lower back. My spine doesn’t curve, it stays flat to the ground.

Other forms of ab work that are done not laying on the ground never seem as effective for me. Planks and mountain climbers tire out my arms more than anything, and as much as I engage my abs I feel like it does nothing. As miserable as crunches are, it really is the most effective for me so I’d like to figure this out.

Has anyone experienced this, and how have you overcome it? Is it usually a hip flexor issue like I believe it is for me? What are some effective alternative ways to work abs that have worked for you?",1,hip flexors back pain crunches,rarely abs forms crunches really kill lower back usually get frustrated call quits little digging decided treat problem issue hip flexors first started stretching hip flexors thinking flexibility issue saw changes weeks tried strengthening instead using different exercises end every session right stretching stop stretching much around time still lower back pain persists use back bench occasionally sure actual name like backwards crunch bend hips pop back deadlifts frequently strengthen lower back still see results far decreased back pain mostly notice back pain crunches require straighten legs ground like leg raises also crunches like russian twist notice pain use incline sit bench well basically crunches bicycles bent leg raises plain jane crunches believe form correct issue abs engaged lower abs pulled spine protect lower back spine curve stays flat ground forms ab work done laying ground never seem effective planks mountain climbers tire arms anything much engage abs feel like nothing miserable crunches really effective like figure anyone experienced overcome usually hip flexor issue like believe effective alternative ways work abs worked,hip flexor back pain crunch ,rarely ab form crunch really kill lower back usually get frustrated call quits little digging decided treat problem issue hip flexor first started stretching hip flexor thinking flexibility issue saw change week tried strengthening instead using different exercise end every session right stretching stop stretching much around time still lower back pain persists use back bench occasionally sure actual name like backwards crunch bend hip pop back deadlifts frequently strengthen lower back still see result far decreased back pain mostly notice back pain crunch require straighten leg ground like leg raise also crunch like russian twist notice pain use incline sit bench well basically crunch bicycle bent leg raise plain jane crunch believe form correct issue ab engaged lower ab pulled spine protect lower back spine curve stay flat ground form ab work done laying ground never seem effective plank mountain climber tire arm anything much engage ab feel like nothing miserable crunch really effective like figure anyone experienced overcome usually hip flexor issue like believe effective alternative way work ab worked ,hip flexor back pain crunch ,rare ab form crunch realli kill lower back usual get frustrat call quit littl dig decid treat problem issu hip flexor first start stretch hip flexor think flexibl issu saw chang week tri strengthen instead use differ exercis end everi session right stretch stop stretch much around time still lower back pain persist use back bench occasion sure actual name like backward crunch bend hip pop back deadlift frequent strengthen lower back still see result far decreas back pain mostli notic back pain crunch requir straighten leg ground like leg rais also crunch like russian twist notic pain use inclin sit bench well basic crunch bicycl bent leg rais plain jane crunch believ form correct issu ab engag lower ab pull spine protect lower back spine curv stay flat ground form ab work done lay ground never seem effect plank mountain climber tire arm anyth much engag ab feel like noth miser crunch realli effect like figur anyon experienc overcom usual hip flexor issu like believ effect altern way work ab work

1519,A Beginner’s Guide to Fitness &amp; Nutrition: Research Based Educational Content &amp; Free Workout Programs,"Hi everyone.

I recently wrote a collection of free detailed workouts and research based educational content for my own personal training clients that I thought might be helpful to some of you here. This is essentially every bit of info that I’d want to teach a new client within the first month or two of training, all laid out in an easy to follow format.

All programs emphasize free weights, target either strength and/or hypertrophy, include supplemental fat loss cardio, and can be downloaded for free in high resolution for easy access. Accompanying the workout programs on my site are research based articles that dive into the ‘why’ and ‘how’ behind major exercise/nutrition topics and provide you with the tools to design and/or tweak your own routines and be more self-sufficient.

Think of my site as an ebook - the Guides are the chapters/sections and the Programs are fully developed examples of the exercise concepts that you can follow or just use as starting points to build/tweak your own workouts.

While there’s a ton of useful stuff all throughout the site (I’m biased) and I’d love for you to browse around, the following links are probably the most important, as they focus on major exercise/nutrition topics and are great starting points for beginners.

* [Nutrition: Fueling For Fitness](https://fitstra.com/nutrition-fueling-for-fitness/) \- How nutrition habits affect exercise performance and research based dietary strategies to help maximize muscle growth, efficiently lose fat, and get the most out of your workouts. (If that's too long of a read, focus on sections 7-9)
* [Strength &amp; Hypertrophy: A Programming Guide](https://fitstra.com/strength-hypertrophy-training/) \- The very basics of strength/hypertrophy training and how to design an effective, research based weight training program.
* [Fat Loss​ Programming](https://fitstra.com/fat-loss-programming/) \- How we lose weight through cardiovascular exercise and an easy to follow, research based guide for fat loss programming.
* [Warming Up: Why &amp; How](https://fitstra.com/warming-up-why-how/) \- The exercise performance benefits of warming up and how to build your own effective routine.
* [Beginner 3\[1.1\]](https://fitstra.com/programs-beginner/) \- This program is an introductory weight lifting routine designed to familiarize those that have little to no previous exercise experience with a few basic movement patterns and the barbell. If you’re interested in incorporating a more serious weight training program into your routine but don’t know where or how to begin, this is the place to start. This program is ideally meant to serve as a temporary (2-6 month) learning period that allows new lifters to transition onto more intense and higher frequency routines.
* [Here are all of the other programs.](https://fitstra.com/programs/) They range from simple Upper/Lower splits to more high volume/frequency Legs/Push/Push variations. Lots of fun, free stuff.

If you have any feedback/criticism/questions, shoot them my way. I’d love to help out if I can. I hope you find the above content useful.

Thanks!

1520,Why is it that so many of us don’t lose weight when we exercise?,"**The reason is simple (but hard to face).**

1. What are we consuming on a daily basis that is making it difficult for us to lose weight
2. How much of this food are we consuming, and is it too much for us to enter into a calorie deficit, in order to shed body fat?
3. Are we grossly underestimating the amount of activity we have to do in order to lose weight?
4. Are we snacking too much, or saying yes to foods that aren't appropriate, when we aren’t hungry?

It does take a conscious effort to really become aware of what’s going on in our day to day life, that is causing us to become stuck. I can say from experience, that it’s the amount of food you eat, what you eat and the activity you don’t do that’s holding you back right now. The first step is to answer the questions above, and become really honest about the answers. You don’t have to share them with anyone. I just want you to be aware of what your truth is. Once you do this, then you have the self-awareness to watch out for the signals, and stop yourself from doing something that sabotages your goal.

Sometimes people don’t or stop losing weight when they restrict their calories so much, that the body thinks it’s in starvation mode. That means, it will hold onto any calorie, and not let it go - even if you reduce your calories more and do extra activities. The truth is, your body wants to keep you alive! As inconvenient as this is, I want you to also keep this in mind when you think that more restriction is the answer. It’s actually not.

The real answer is that our bodies just want to be in balance. How do we keep in a state of homeostasis for zen-like balance? I haven’t discovered this consistently, but I do know that never letting your body know what is really going on, can keep it guessing and never knowing what you are really doing. What does this mean anyway? It means doing a variety of things like [fasting](https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/keto-and-intermittent-fasting-a-beginners-guide), low calorie, high calorie, [low carb](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb), high carb, keto and then a cheat meal. All this, challenging our body to never know what is going on, can have amazing effects on your physique! Not to mention that you actually don’t feel deprived, have huge cravings, or the need to drool over chocolate anymore. Let me give you a quick rundown of what this all means:-

**Day 1 (Monday)** *High carb,* low-fat day, low-calorie day and heaps of veggies

**Day 2 (Tuesday)** *High fat day,* high fat dinner, nuts and oils

**Day 3 (Wednesday)** *Very low-calorie day* consisting of salad eggs, tuna and white fish for protein sources

**Day 4 (Thursday)** *High carb day, low-fat day.* Sweet potato with chicken breast, salad, piece of pork with white and sweet potato.

There is no right or wrong here, just whatever works best for you. Weight loss is all about creating a calorie deficit, and the strategy above helps you do that, without too much restriction in foods. I know it takes some time to get used to, but your goal is to lose weight. Do whatever is needed in order to achieve this goal.",1,many us lose weight exercise,reason simple hard face 1 consuming daily basis making difficult us lose weight 2 much food consuming much us enter

1523,"To morning work out people, what is your ritual?","TLDR- ADHD fat ass/overgrown child has a hard time with habits, schedules, and routines, only solution is to make it all automatic. Tell me what works for you!

Specifically asking people who get up every morning and work out- What exactly does your whole schedule look like? Do you wake up, eat breakfast, go run/etc., and then shower and get ready for the day, and start on your commute, go to work, etc? What does your night time routine look like? What do you do at night to get ready for the next day? 

I’m trying to figure out a very detailed schedule that I want to make into a habit so I do these things automatically, and I think I’m getting caught up in the logistics of it. 

I’d like to work out at school in the morning but I don’t want to shower there (icky), but I have morning classes so it would be nonsensical to get up and drive there and back home and back to school. 
Should I get a new gym closer to home? 
Should I just go for a morning run around my very safe neighborhood? 
How early do y’all shoot to get up to fit all that in?

You can see why I’m so bad at this by now, yes? Lol
I just need to set a routine that works that I don’t have to think about every day. The deciding what to do is where I always mess up (usually by being overwhelmed and shutting down)

1524,Any fun ways to exercise?,"Starting of: I don't like exercise... Bad start i know... But i need to move more, i'm overweight. Luckily i'm not too much out of shape, i can bicycle at around 25km/h for 10km and not consider it a big effort, if i switch my shirt you'd think I got there by car. (Running 100 meters will get me panting like crazy...)

Problem is while i cycle around 60km a week, that's pretty much it for movement... Less than 3 hours a week.
Sure i walk my dog and do groceries on foot, but that is barely exercise.

And each of these including the cycling (commute) are functional and I can't get around them. I have kettlebells at home but I can't be bothered to use them.


TLDR: need to exercise more but need it to be either fun or functional, what should I do?

1553,Yoga For Relaxation: Pose Tutorial,"A healthy balance between mind, body, and spirit are essential for moving forward and embracing new beginnings. And this is why I love Yoga; we can nurture all three aspects of our being in one beautiful practice. Yoga is a science, a philosophy, an art. Yoga teaches us how to co-exist with all other life within the world. It is a lifestyle. It is a practice. It is a way of being.

The word “yoga” comes from the Sanskrit root **yuj**, which means “to join” or “to yoke.” Through this ancient philosophy, we can make our bodies strong and flexible, improve the functioning of our internal systems (respiratory, circulatory, digestive, and hormonal), and develop emotional stability and a more peaceful state of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Through **asana (postures / poses)** and the breath, we can immediately begin experiencing the wonderful benefits of this ancient science. You don’t have to be able to put your foot behind your head or stand on your head or go to a fancy studio and wear expensive gear to experience yoga.  All you need is a quiet space, a blanket or a mat, and your breath. It is that simple… and yet so, so powerful.

So I created this blog series, ***Yoga For Relaxation,*** to share yoga postures that I know will help you relax and recharge. The cool thing about this series is that you can do the whole sequence, a combination, or just do one of these postures for an extended amount of time. It is a totally flexible sequence, do one or do them all, totally up to you. Remember that flexibility is key to managing stress and change, so feel free to adapt this series to your needs.

Through this pose, you will learn how to calm your mind, relax your body, and focus on your breath.

*Instructions*: Lie on your back on the floor (on your blanket or mat). Your arms are about 5 inches away from your body with your palms facing up to the sky, your legs are about hip-width apart.  Your body is relaxed, and your eyes are closed. Bring your awareness to your breath; close your mouth and focus on deep breaths in and out of your nose, allowing the body to sink into the earth. Allow your thoughts to float away as you relax and breathe, enjoying the quiet stillness, allowing your body and your mind to rest. *Savasana* can last as long as you would like – I would recommend setting a timer for anywhere between 5-20 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

 When ready to exit the pose, keep your eyes closed as you gently roll your head side to side and move your fingers and toes. Bring your arms up over your head and take a stretch, reaching through your fingers and toes. Bring your arms back down and grab your legs as you bring them into your chest. Roll gently side to side, before rolling over to your right side, and when you are ready, gently push yourself into a seated position. Take a few deep breaths, open your eyes, and smile.

1555,Very sore in an unusual place - how can I make it better faster?,"I don't know if this is an unusual place to be sore, but it's unusual for me. I did a bunch of single leg raises two days ago, and the place between my inner thigh and my groin is really sore. I guess it would be the inner thigh joint or something? It was pretty bad yesterday, but today it's even worse. The worst pain is when I go from sitting to standing, even if I've only been sitting for a few minutes. It takes me a few seconds to even be able to straighten out all the way. I also walk a bit stiffly.

I don't know if I did the exercise wrong or if I just did more than what my body could handle, but how can I make the pain go away as fast as possible? I tried to do some stretches after I exercised and yesterday as well, but I feel worse, not better. I'm not sure if I should be icing it or something, but it's not a very nice area to put ice on.",1,sore unusual place make better faster,know unusual place sore unusual bunch single leg raises two days ago place inner thigh groin really sore guess would inner thigh joint something pretty bad yesterday today even worse worst pain go sitting standing even sitting minutes takes seconds even able straighten way also walk bit stiffly know exercise wrong body could handle make pain go away fast possible tried stretches exercised yesterday well feel worse better sure icing something nice area put ice,sore unusual place make better faster ,know unusual place sore unusual bunch single leg raise two day ago place inner thigh groin really sore guess would inner thigh joint something pretty bad yesterday today even worse worst pain go sitting standing even sitting minute take second even able straighten way also walk bit stiffly know exercise wrong body could handle make pain go away fast possible tried stretch exercised yesterday well feel worse better sure icing something nice area put ice ,sore unusu place make better faster ,know unusu place sore unusu bunch singl leg rais two day ago place inner thigh groin realli sore guess would inner thigh joint someth pretti bad yesterday today even wors worst pain go sit stand even sit minut take second even abl straighten way also walk bit stiffli know exercis wrong bodi could handl make pain go away fast possibl tri stretch exercis yesterday well feel wors better sure ice someth nice area put ice

1570,Core exercise suggestions,"What are your go to's for core strengthening exercises?  My back locks up, below my ribs.  Had everything checked.  Dr. said to strengthen my core.  I looked at stuff online.  I was doing back strokes in the pool while waiting on dr to look at back.

Started back to gym this week.  I decided on incline walking., walking until I felt anything and building slowly from there.  

Monday I did 20 min and felt a twinge in right side, so I stopped (4.5 incline 2.5 mph) Thought I would increase by 30 sec to min going forward if I could.  Went back today.  Didn't feel any pain, but stopped at 25 min.  Now its 2 hours later and my left back is tightening and hurting.

Maybe I decided on wrong thing.  What is the fastest way to get core muscles strengthened?  The gym has free weights, nautilus, pool.  All manner of stair steppers, ellipticals, rowing, bikes, a machine that looks like a stepper but moves in a roundish pattern. I also am not adverse to yoga if that is something that would be the most beneficial.  Floor exercises, fine.

So, what do you got?  What you think is the quickest? And what is a reasonable amount of time to see results?   I'm about 40 lbs overweight, and doing keto (dropped about 30) because I know the weight adds to the issue.  

Is there anything after your workout you do that is beneficial?

Now, finally, I'm ready to start. Get back in the saddle. I have tangible goals (tough mudder 2021 here I come!) that are motivating...and I finally got weightlifting equipment for home!

1599,How to recover a seemingly atrophied chest?,"Hello.

I've read that atrophied muscles come mostly from inactivity; in my case, it's because of near-to-none activity in my years of important physical development.  
Today, my chest has almost all ribs visible, I can't do one complete push-up, I'm extremely fragile when tightening muscles or when engaging them in fast movements, and very vulnerable to punches.

The reason behind this post is to ask how can I build a healthy chest, some good exercises and techniques, and a good diet that accompanies the rutines.  
In a random search, I found a few pictures such as [this](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=8218361&amp;d=1458256257) that make me ask if I might suffer from that, or if I will have it by accidently forcing my chest muscles.

1600,What workout would be best for me ?,"Hi guys 	!

So, a little backstory - I am absolutely not fit. I am a 17 y/o female, about 148cm and I weigh 60kg. I haven’t exercised in a year due to exams and i hate how out of shape I am, how I can’t run or jump or anything without being out of breath and in pain after a couple of seconds. It’s pathetic. 

As an indicator of how “fit” I am: sixty seconds of on the spot running and I’m out of breath. I can manage about twenty crunches in a row, and like one press up haha. 

In September I want to go back to volleyball, and I want to get good enough to potentially play for my uni when I go to uni. To do that, i will need to be in shape enough to run and jump etc. So.. as someone who has absolutely no idea how to exercise, what should I do? I don’t have access to a gym so will have to be home workouts. I also don’t have any weights. If you guys could suggest some specific routines and maybe even some dietary recommendations, that’d be great ! (Looking more for workout routines than food stuff tho)

Currently I’m doing 60 seconds running on the spot, 50 star jumps, 40 seconds walk sit, 30 seconds plank, 20 crunches and then ten stretches to finish it off. This is just a random routine I cobbled together and I’m aware that it’s probably not enough and the exercises I chose are likely not very effective.

1613,"21, skinny, starting to work out. When I stretch certain muscles 2 days later I get very sick, keep waking up all night and having intense vivid dreams. Anyone experienced this?","Backstory: Like I said I'm 21 and never really have done much of any exercise. Over the past two years I've drastically cut down on the food I eat because for some reason I get sick after eating a big meal or certain foods. I avoid greesey food like cheeseburgers. I have been forcing myself to eat more but I crash and feel tired and sick after really any meal and I get bad brain fog too and diarrhea. I've been eating a small steak almost daily lately and a protein fruit smoothie almost every morning. I've been doing lifting light weights at home. I'm so weak that anything helps relieve the tension regardless of what muscles I'm working.

I have a condition kind of like PTSD. I don't want to say the name because not many people have it and I don't want this post to be traced back to me for personal reasons. Just imagine I'm extremely weak and I carry an extreme amount of stress in my body and all throught the day my whole body locks up and my brain and body are in a fight or flight mode as if my life is in danger or I'm facing impending doom. If you've ever experienced that type of thing or any actual trauma.

To get to the point, over the past year I've randomly tried a couple stretches that work my core simple things like laying in bed and lifting my legs up and holding them for a moment. Immediatey my abdomens starts quivering and when I put my legs down I feel the muscle release a little. I was never aware of the tension in my body until I tried this. The issue is, like clockwork 2 days later I go to bed feeling fine but I wake up every 2 hours the entire night with insomnia and with what feels like the flu. I feel so sore to. Nonstop dreams all night...Everytime I wake it feels like my braim wasnt sleeping so i feel exhausted. It doesnt stop the whole night and throughout the next day or 2 it goes on and I feel sick and sore and tired like I dont even have energy to walk. Usually I think I caught something until it hits me that I had done that stretch 2 days prior. After it happened 3 times over a few months I started catching on. I'm more determined to get in shape so I'm going to keep doing the same stretch and hopefully it goes away over time.

I've told a few ppl about this and they think I'm crazy. Others tell me looney stuff like that my body is letting go of trauma stored in my muscles lol.

I'm just curious, has anyone experienced this before?? I'm sitting here in bed feeling weak and sick because I randomly decided to try a stretch two days ago and  last night it happened again. I'll say it's happened maybe 5 times in the past year or 2. But it's identical in every way every single time. I can actually predict whether it's going to happen now.

TLDR: I'm weak as shit and have PTSD and carry a ton of stress and when I've tried doing a very light stretch on my abdomen, lower chest, I end up getting sick 2 days later like i have the flu and Ill feel super lethargic and will have extremely vivid dreams all night to no end and it always goes on for 2 days before I feel better and I'm wondering if anyone has heard of this or experienced it before. Tried looking it up online and can't find anyone who has had this happen.

1625,Old fart on treadmill -- seems good way to improve stamina -- just hanging on a little longer.,"A long ago I ran a variety of marathons in Hawaii and in Portland, Oregon.

I remember that when I started running I thought I was in pain, could not do it, etc. And so I jogged past a telephone as long as I could and then walked to the next pole. I did this day after day and was able to run much further and completed more than 15 marathons.

Now at seventy I today am learning lessons from my past.

On my treadmill today rather than walking at 1.5 mph I walked at 1.8 mph and at 7.5 minutes is was exhausted and took a break (I was sweaty and breathing hard). When I stopped I turned off my watches timer and continued to read in my book for about a page and a half and then completed 30 minutes of heavy workout, turning my watch timer off When I was not walking. (I also wear ankle weights and breathe every fourth step.)

At any rate I think I now have the means to systematically get better and it does not seem too difficult.

I believe if I do this for a month or two my stamina will be much higher, like jogging past telephone poles, which I did three decades ago.

How do you ramp up your difficulty factory?",1,old fart treadmill seems good way improve stamina hanging little longer,long ago ran variety marathons hawaii portland oregon remember started running thought pain could etc jogged past telephone long could walked next pole day day able run much completed 15 marathons seventy today learning lessons past treadmill today rather walking 1 5 mph walked 1 8 mph 7 5 minutes exhausted took break sweaty breathing hard stopped turned watches timer continued read book page half completed 30 minutes heavy workout turning watch timer walking also wear ankle weights breathe every fourth step rate think means systematically get better seem difficult believe month two stamina much higher like jogging past telephone poles three decades ago ramp difficulty factory,old fart treadmill seems good way improve stamen hanging little longer ,long ago ran variety marathon hawaii portland oregon remember started running thought pain could etc jogged past telephone long could walked next pole day day able run much completed 15 marathon seventy today learning lesson past treadmill today rather walking 1 5 mph walked 1 8 mph 7 5 minute exhausted took break sweaty breathing hard stopped turned watch timer continued read book page half completed 30 minute heavy workout turning watch timer walking also wear ankle weight breathe every fourth step rate think mean systematically get better seem difficult believe month two stamen much higher like jogging past telephone pole three decade ago ramp difficulty factory ,old fart treadmil seem good way improv stamina hang littl longer ,long ago ran varieti marathon hawaii portland oregon rememb start run thought pain could etc jog past telephon long could walk next pole day day abl run much complet 15 marathon seventi today learn lesson past treadmil today rather walk 1 5 mph walk 1 8 mph 7 5 minut exhaust took break sweati breath hard stop turn watch timer continu read book page half complet 30 minut heavi workout turn watch timer walk also wear ankl weight breath everi fourth step rate think mean systemat get better seem difficult believ month two stamina much higher like jog past telephon pole three decad ago ramp difficulti factori

1627,25 Skinny guy looking to put on muscle for the first time. Need help with creating lifting routine.,"I’m a 25 year old guy who is going back to college to get another degree at the beginning of September and it seemed like a good time to finally commit to physical fitness. I’m 6’1” and currently around 160lbs. I’ve moderately exercised off and on throughout my life, but I’ve never fully committed for more than a month or two and mostly focused on cardio, so this will be my first experience with serious weight training. 

I’ve tried looking for routines and advice online, but with so many sources it has been kind of overwhelming. I found [this routine](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/defeat-skinny-genetics-the-1-1-skinny-guy-transformation-program.html) and was planning on following it to get started, but I had some concerns. I plan to go to the gym by myself most of the time, so I most likely won’t have a spotter (at least when I start) so I’m hesitant to bench and squat alone. The fitness facility at my school is pretty big and there are plenty of weight machines there. Would these machines be a good alternative to using traditional weights? I’ve also heard that 3 times a week is a good amount to go to the gym so your body has time to recover and actually build muscle, is this true? Any advice about training by yourself or good routines for skinny beginner lifters would be greatly appreciated!

tl;dr: I’ve never really lifted before so I have no idea what I’m doing. Looking for some help with a good routine for beginners that does not require someone to spot you.

Today I still feel it from the workout.

question is: sometimes on my rest day I feel like I could squeeze another workout (it's not a matter of ""you haven't worked hard enough, please don't go there), have you tried training the same muscle groups day after day?

1651,"Desperately seeking help in exercising. I don't know where to start, or even what to do.","Pretty much what the title is, is the TL;DR.  And this post will probably be all over the place, so please bear with me.

I need help.  I need a lot of help.  I am nearing 300 LBS, and I am struggling to even start a routine to get fit.  I know, I know ""Diet helps the most."".  I get it, I really do.  But I have trouble stopping my self from eating.  I have moderation control issues when it comes to food and snacks.

I just visited my doctor earlier to day for my yearly physical, and I talked with him about starting to do a few things to lose weight so I can sleep better, and have more energy, but I honestly don't know exactly where to start.

To put things simply, I work third shift.  I leave the house at 4 PM, and don't get back until 3-6 AM, and I do this from Sunday to Thursday.  So, by the time Friday rolls around, I'm getting home in the early hours of the day, and sleeping until 12-2 PM.  So, I honestly have a hard time setting a schedule to actually work out.  My job is building, and pulling pallets of upwards 500 LBS+ while rushing through the ware house, so I am also exhausted by the time I get home.

I keep thinking to my self ""I should do some push ups."", but then never get around to doing them.  I think about it, but never do it.  It always starts that way though.  ""I should do this."" but don't actually do it until I forget about it.  I am done with that, and want to better my life, now.

I also am VERY self conscious about doing any exercise thanks to my brothers always making remarks whenever I tried to do ANYTHING that wasn't ""normal"" as in sit around the house watching TV.  Hell, I even went outside to do stuff, but had a very, very hard time to actually do them, even though it was 3 in the morning, and I was completely alone, my wife and son asleep in side.

While I was outside, I did a bunch of googling to find beginner stuff, and I found squats.  After hyping my self up to even attempt to do them, I couldn't do them.  Simply couldn't thanks to knee pain.  I go down like how it shows, and my knee hurts.  Did some more googling, and I found that push ups are good.  I can't do many of them, so I used the outside steps to elevate a bit to make them easier and managed to do 3 sets of 5.  Felt slightly better, but hesitant about doing more because of ""what if some one sees me and says something.""

Looked more online, and found lunges.  Again, same thing.  Managed to do 3 sets of 5 on each leg.  And now my legs are shaky, very shaky.  But, it was easy just to do those, even if I felt silly doing them outside and again ""what if some one saw me.""

I also know about walking, and I am trying to do more of it from besides all the jogging I do at work.

So, all I'm able to do is 3 sets of 5 push ups with using something to elevate my self, and 3 sets of 5 squats each leg.  

I know this one was pretty much all over the place, but I guess I'm kind of looking for validation as well.  Something to help me get to do it every day.

I'm also looking for people to give me advice on what else I can do as a literal beginner for exercise.  I don't live in a big place, so there isn't a lot of room for me to do some stuff.  Does anyone have any resources to help a beginner get into doing it, and to keep doing it?

Also, on a side note, is it ok to do lunges and push ups multiple times a day, every day?  I know I don't want to strain my self just starting out, so I won't do it if it's not good to do.

1668,Advice on exercising/exercise schedule and dieting,"Hello everyone! I am a beginner at this, and I wanted to see what advice the fitness community could give to a beginner like me, so here I am.

For starters: I am a boy. I am 14 yrs old, and I weigh 106lbs, and 5'8. I want to build up some muscle, loose my belly fat, and gain some weight (goal is 120lbs) healthily.

My exercise schedule consists of this: 

Monday: Leg day- Exercises include squats, lunges, running, walking, mountain climbers, and back squats. When I am not doing walking or running, I am doing 25-50 reps of exercise for 1hr. 

Tuesday and Thursday: Core Day- Exercises include sit-ups, crunches, planks, deadbugs, and the half kneeling wood chop. Both days last a minimum of 30 min, and maximum an hour. So it is 1-2 hrs of core exercise per week.

Friday: Arm day- Exercises include lifting 5-10lb weights, planks, and push ups. I do these exercises for one hour.

Wedsnday and Saturday: Break days, no exercise.

Saturday: Aerobics- Exercises include running, walking, cycling, jumping jacks, burpees and squats.

(Note: I have only done Wedsnday.)

Diet: I eat somewhat unhealthy, as mealtime normally consists of processed foods and frozen foods/dairy. However, I am trying to make it a habit of eating 1 fruit a day, and I am starting to eat salads.

Any and all advice is welcome. P.s. if you could suggest any exercises to add to my daily routine, that would be extremely helpful as I have little idea to what exercises I should do, and what exercises are effective.",1,advice exercising exercise schedule dieting,hello everyone beginner wanted see advice fitness community could give beginner like starters boy 14 yrs old weigh 106lbs 5 8 want build muscle loose belly fat gain weight goal 120lbs healthily exercise schedule consists monday leg day exercises include squats lunges running walking mountain climbers back squats walking running 25 50 reps exercise 1hr tuesday thursday core day exercises include sit ups crunches planks deadbugs half kneeling wood chop days last minimum 30 min maximum hour 1 2 hrs core exercise per week friday arm day exercises include lifting 5 10lb weights planks push ups exercises one hour wedsnday saturday break days exercise saturday aerobics exercises include running walking cycling jumping jacks burpees squats note done wedsnday diet eat somewhat unhealthy mealtime normally consists processed foods frozen foods dairy however trying make habit eating 1 fruit day starting eat salads advice welcome p could suggest exercises add daily routine would extremely helpful little idea exercises exercises effective,advice exercising exercise schedule dieting ,hello everyone beginner wanted see advice fitness community could give beginner like starter boy 14 yr old weigh 106lbs 5 8 want build muscle loose belly fat gain weight goal 120lbs healthily exercise schedule consists monday leg day exercise include squat lunge running walking mountain climber back squat walking running 25 50 rep exercise 1hr tuesday thursday core day exercise include sit ups crunch plank deadbugs half kneeling wood chop day last minimum 30 min maximum hour 1 2 hr core exercise per week friday arm day exercise include lifting 5 10lb weight plank push ups exercise one hour wedsnday saturday break day exercise saturday aerobics exercise include running walking cycling jumping jack burpees squat note done wedsnday diet eat somewhat unhealthy mealtime normally consists processed food frozen food dairy however trying make habit eating 1 fruit day starting eat salad advice welcome p could suggest exercise add daily routine would extremely helpful little idea exercise exercise effective ,advic exercis exercis schedul diet ,hello everyon beginn want see advic fit commun could give beginn like starter boy 14 yr old weigh 106lb 5 8 want build muscl loos belli fat gain weight goal 120lb healthili exercis schedul consist monday leg day exercis includ squat lung run walk mountain climber back squat walk run 25 50 rep exercis 1hr tuesday thursday core day exercis includ sit up crunch plank deadbug half kneel wood chop day last minimum 30 min maximum hour 1 2 hr core exercis per week friday arm day exercis includ lift 5 10lb weight plank push up exercis one hour wedsnday saturday break day exercis saturday aerob exercis includ run walk cycl jump jack burpe squat note done wedsnday diet eat somewhat unhealthi mealtim normal consist process food frozen food dairi howev tri make habit eat 1 fruit day start eat salad advic welcom p could suggest exercis add daili routin would extrem help littl idea exercis exercis effect

I am worried though that if I exercise I’m going to end up losing my boobs before I lose my stomach. 

So, to skip to the end, can I do exercise that just targets my stomach?

1703,advice for a total beginner,"Hi everyone. Im a total beginner to working out. Up until recently I havent done any form of exercise since high school gym class (13 years ago).

Im extremely out of shape, Ive been losing weight through dieting but want to add exercise as well.  


Anyways, all ive been doing is basically walking and then running as for as long as I can. Usually I end up walking about a half mile, running a quarter mile and then repeating that process a few times. At this point running that quarter mile kicks my butt!!!. But im hoping it will get easier and I will be able to run further and further.   


I have several friends who work out a lot and they keep telling me that what im doing in not enough. They are telling me I need to run longer and more distance......But at this point I dont think im in shape to do that!  


Are they right? or should I keep doing what Im doing?.....or is there something different I need to do?

1715,Exercise in the morning vs exercise at noon.,"Exercise is a must for my mental health, if I don't do it, my quality of life is reduced significantly. The most consistent I've ever been with exercise though, was a small period of about a month in which I went to a gym everyday at around 7:30 am. I feel like exercise in the morning fits me better, because you get it out of the way quickly, you can't really think about it, you just wake up and go. And afterwards you don't even feel tired, you stay super energized for the rest of the day (at least that's how remember feeling*).*

Even though I consider myself a night owl rather than a morning person, I feel like it's easier to do first thing in the morning. After a while it didn't even felt like I was loosing time of the day at all, in fact, my days began to feel longer, it felt as if I actually had more time than before I began with the short lived habit.

But currently I have school in the morning, and I don't know if trying to fit a workout before 7am would be pushing it too far for me.

I also know that my title is worded badly and you cannot put on muscle and lose weight at the same time... and i'm happy with my body but I want to be better, so don't worry about my age and my mental health.
pictures:[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/f2TvxHD.jpg)
I weigh 136lbs, 9st 7lbs or 61.5kg at the time of pictures but 2-3 weeks ago I weighed 140lbs 9st 10lbs or 63.5kg.
I have started trying to eat more healthy and do some exercise recently (about 2-3 weeks ago). I run 1-2 miles everyday apart from Friday and Saturday due to health concerns (I have Crohns disease and have methotrexate injections every Thursday so on Friday-Saturday I always feel sick). I also try to fit in some ab exercises because having abs would be really nice, the ab video I follow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkKCVCZe474&amp;list=WL.
My meals in a day go as follow:
Breakfast: 2 weetabix.
Snack: Banana after a run.
Lunch: skip
Snack: sometimes some chicken breast (about 40-50 grams of protein)
Dinner: Usually something unhealthy that my mom makes.
Snack: Apple
What I want to know is, is this routine good or does it need changing and if so how can I improve this at home as my parents said no to the gym.
Thanks guys, looking forward to seeing replys.

1734,Can I only jog?,"Hi everyone, hope this is the right sub for this- I have no idea what I’m doing.  

So, basically, I’m an 18 year old female who hasn’t really exercised a day in her life. Thankfully, I’m not overweight (129 lbs and 5’3) but the fact I live an unhealthy life does bother me. Also I have some mental health stuff and I’ve read exercise can help with that so I’d love to get off the couch. 

However, I come from a very athletic family and I’ve tried all sorts of activities  (swimming, weights, yoga, basketball, dance, random classes at the gym, etc) in the past and nothing ever sticks- I just can’t commit because I don’t enjoy it. 

I do, however, walk around the neighborhood at least once a week to get out the house. I’ve found I enjoy it and I’m kind of thinking about trying jogging since I don’t find going around my neighborhood boring. Also, that way my family doesn’t have to get involved because I don’t want their expectations placed on me again. 

My question is: is only running an okay form of exercise? I’m really ignorant about these kinds of things. I’ve heard you’re supposed to balance strength training and running and whatnot... if I’m just looking to be active can I just skip that? If I shouldn’t, are there any tips for me to commit to something? Or tips for a beginner in general I guess.

Problem is, i've never done this kind of stuff before, so I was wondering if any of you         guys/gals could tell me how I could start or with what. Should I just try to do push ups or sit ups all morning or is there some specific things I have to do first or something?

1744,Advice for starting an exercise routine,"Right now I walk. I live downtown and pretty much everything is in walking distance - including my job. I also have a husky - we go on frequent walks during the day. They tend to be shorter right now because of the heat. 

I’d like to add on to it with some weight training, yoga, Pilates, etc. but I don’t know where/how to start. I have a really nice gym in my building but I’m kind of intimidated by the weight machines. And there’s the whole “weight training diet” I’ve heard about from friends who do it daily. Do I need to start subscribing to that?

I’m not looking to lose weight - just tone up. I’ve suffered from depression and I know there are a ton of benefits of exercising. I’d like to have more definition in my arms, abs, and thighs. Some core exercises have proven to be difficult as I have some mild lower back issues. 

Another reason is I’m trying to quit smoking. I’m doing decently well but have the occasional cigarette. I’m working with my doctor and she has encouraged me to have a more consistent routine. 

There seem to be a lot of options and it gets a little overwhelming. Any advice or personal experience you guys could share would be great.

My arms and chest are already uneven (one side bigger than the other) but I am evening out my chest and arms I just don't want the same thing to happen to my stomach.

I tried shifting my weight to the right side and stuff but I still don't feel anything and when it does get sore its not as much as the other side.

1769,Heart Rate questions,"Heya. 

Does a higher heart-rate in itself do anything for fat loss/muscle building/any positive benefit or is it just an indicator of how much you're exerting? Probably just the latter, right? Does the heart increase in strength, can you build heart (valve?) muscle? If so, what exactly does that do, pump blood stronger? That seems both good and bad...

I'm unable to break 155-160 HR, no matter the exertion level, anymore, due to I guess being too fit - does that matter at all? I was always taught/read you want to be in the 170-180 range (for my age) for best gains, or was that simply a guideline to ensure you're putting your all into the workout? I kinda miss that level of heart-pounding, gasping for air... Now I know how to breathe too well. 

Ancillary questions: Are endorphins relaxing or exciting? I've noticed I have more energy the more sore I am, well, when I break through mentally the initial ""oh god everything hurts"". Is it endorphins or adrenaline making me smile uncontrollably and want to laugh as I push through every muscle going  oh fuck fine let's go? The chemicals from exercise are more fun than any drug.

Does increased muscle mass put more strain on joints? Can joints themselves be strengthened, do tendons and ligaments get stronger - through exercise, just nutrition, both? 

Have you noticed people becoming jealous, fearful or assuming you're stupid, the more muscle you put on? It sucks, it's just so fun to exercise and push yourself, I don't even care about the fitness or muscle aspect...

1799,Physio after dislocation,"Hi all, not sure this is the best place to post this but figured people doing exercise might also have previously injured themselves!

I dislocated my kneecap six weeks ago and began physio yesterday. One of the things I was told to do was to keen trying to push my knee to bend to the point of discomfort throughout the day (it's completely stiff after about 70 degrees after being in a brace for so long). I've done this at my desk all day, but my knee has now swollen to probably the level of swelling I had when I first dislocated it.

I don't want to stop doing the physio exercises as I want to make sure my knee recovers, but I've always known swelling to be bad. So my question is I guess should I continue to do them as swelling is just part of the healing? Or am I pushing it too much too soon? Any advice welcome. I'm next I'm with the physio on Sunday, but wanted to try to make as much progress as possible in the initial few days after the brace. 

Thanks all

1808,Are my goals realistic?,"I've been weightlifting for a few months, but I recently added cardio to the mix. I'm very small, 5""5' with pretty much no muscle mass.

I am weight lifting Monday, Wednesday, Friday, alternating between leg days and upper body days. I am also doing cardio throughout the week. Nothing on the weekends.

Currently, I'm doing a 10 minute mile daily for my cardio. My first goal is to do 2 miles in 20 minutes daily. I'd like to get to that point and then up the ante on Tuesday/Thursdays with cardio. Probably moving to 3 or 4 miles those days, while keeping to 2 miles Monday, Wed, Fri.

I don't go too hard with weight lifting. I just try to do more on occasion, but without hurting myself. I dont want to become this huge buff woman. More like reach a point that I like my muscles and then maintain.

My real question is about the cardio. Is this a sustainable workout? Are there underlying risks I'm taking by running this much? Should I be doing something different?

1809,"Exercising for health reasons, not a lot of time. Are multiple shorter exercises OK?","So am a business owner and we are still in the early stages. Because of this I'm very busy working a ton and then have a lot going on after work, out of town a lot of weekends, etc.

My daily schedule is pretty much:

1. Wake up at 5am and work til 5pm.
2. Cook and eat by 6pm.
3. Usually pretty busy with life stuff 6-10. Time with husband, TV, going out to do stuff. 
4. Relax in bed 10-11 and go to sleep at 11.

I have home exercise equipment: Treadmill, exercise bike, a bowflex.

So I'm overweight and just found out I have very low T which has contributed to the weight gain and inability to lose weight. I also have pretty bad, low, ""good cholesterol"" and the doctor said I really need to exercise more and I can't just sit at my desk 12 hours a day and should get up and stretch for a few minutes every hour. Especially because my new meds cause thick blood which can contribute to blood clots. 

This scares me because I have family history of heart attacks and heart problems. 

Since I don't have a ton of time what I have been doing is:

1. Work 5am-7am
2. 20 mins of cardio (about 200 calories) 
3. Every hour of work I take a 5 min break and walk briskly/bike quickly for cardio (about 45 calories each time) - instead of just stretching in front of my desk 
4. Sometimes I can squeeze in another 20-30 mins in the evenings. 

That gives me 20 mins in the morning and about 40 mins sporadically throughout the day.

My main question is... Is that 40 mins sporadically OK or should I just be stretching and doing an additional 30 mins I can probably squeeze in during the evenings? Will the 40 mins sporadically help me lose weight by burning calories or does 5 mins not get the body going enough to actually contribute?

Edit: I'd also like to say I really am not concerned with gaining muscle mass or strength, etc. Just want to exercise to stay healthy, prevent heart problems and lose weight.

1831,Is it safe to run with a herniated disc?,"About 3 years ago I herniated a disc from deadlifting, and got bad sciatica which I still have today. I got surgery a few months after I got the herniation, but it involved a lot of complications due to an incompetent doctor, and ever since I haven't done much physically. The reason I began working out in the first place was I wanted to get in the best shape I could be in, and I've decided to go after that goal again but be safer. I ran for the first time in about two years about a week ago and ran four miles with no pain. I ran three miles a few days ago and stopped due to muscle soreness. But today when I ran, around mile three I started to get this weird nervy feeling in my right glute (my sciatic pain runs down my left glute) and it reminded me of sciatica. It scared me, but like a moron I pushed myself to go an extra mile. I still kinda feel it when I put pressure on my right leg, but I'm lying down an it feels fine.

1848,Can't Really Afford Gym Membership - Need to Work Out at Home - Tips?,"# 

Hi, I didn't see any [r/Exercise-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise-specific/) rules, so I hope this isn't against any rules. I'm sure this has been asked before but I didn't want to google it because I wanted to hear from real people, not some website or magazine.

With gas and other costs I can't really afford or make time to go to the gym. I know exercising is a commitment but if I can set aside time at home to do it I'm willing to commit; that cuts out driving time and a monthly fee. Plus I know myself and I worry I'll just pull an ""I'll just go tomorrow"" and never go, but if it's right at home it'll be less easy for me to avoid it. ALSO, my anxiety goes insane at the gym and I end up holding myself back and just staying on a treadmill the whole time. Long story short I've never gotten anything done at the gym. I'd like to try in the future, but I want to get to a point where I'm more comfortable in my skin, and I need to start at home for that.

I'm a male who weighs about 195 pounds, about 30-50 pounds more than I weighed a year ago. The last 10 months or so I started eating a lot more unhealthily, and I've never really had to exercise in my life to keep fit, just got lucky with the metabolism and what not. I've developed a sort of mini-gut and my thighs have gotten bigger.

I wanted tips on what I can do at home on a consistent schedule that will help me get my weight back down to the 140s/150s. I know eating goes very much with exercise, so I'm gonna post in another sub about that.

Any help at all is so appreciated.

1. **Sleep.** Sleep is the only thing absolutely proven to aid recovery time. You also produce most of your [HGH](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/29/1/20/2715789/Growth-Hormone-Secretion-During-Nocturnal-Sleep-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext) during the deep phases of your sleep, so long uninterrupted sleep is needed. Aim for 9–10 hours on your heavy days and at least 8 every day. Wake up at the same time every day if at all possible.
2. **Protein.** If your protein intake is extremely low recovery will definitely be hindered. There is some evidence post workout protein increases recovery, and protein intake in the following 48 hours has a significant factor as well.

Some people will suggest massage, ice baths, Epsom salts, and others, but while some studies suggest they may reduce soreness none has proven to aid recovery.",1,best way heal muscles working,honestly think two things make real difference comes muscle recovery https hvmn com blog training muscle recovery essential next workout 1 sleep sleep thing absolutely proven aid recovery time also produce hgh https academic oup com jcem article abstract 29 1 20 2715789 growth hormone secretion nocturnal sleep redirectedfrom fulltext deep phases sleep long uninterrupted sleep needed aim 9 10 hours heavy days least 8 every day wake time every day possible 2 protein protein intake extremely low recovery definitely hindered evidence post workout protein increases recovery protein intake following 48 hours significant factor well people suggest massage ice baths epsom salts others studies suggest may reduce soreness none proven aid recovery,best way heal muscle working ,honestly think two thing make real difference come muscle recovery http hvmn com blog training muscle recovery essential next workout 1 sleep sleep thing absolutely proven aid recovery time also produce hgh http academic oup com jcem article abstract 29 1 20 2715789 growth hormone secretion nocturnal sleep redirectedfrom fulltext deep phase sleep long uninterrupted sleep needed aim 9 10 hour heavy day least 8 every day wake time every day possible 2 protein protein intake extremely low recovery definitely hindered evidence post workout protein increase recovery protein intake following 48 hour significant factor well people suggest massage ice bath epsom salt others study suggest may reduce soreness none proven aid recovery ,best way heal muscl work ,honestli think two thing make real differ come muscl recoveri http hvmn com blog train muscl recoveri essenti next workout 1 sleep sleep thing absolut proven aid recoveri time also produc hgh http academ oup com jcem articl abstract 29 1 20 2715789 growth hormon secret nocturn sleep redirectedfrom fulltext deep phase sleep long uninterrupt sleep need aim 9 10 hour heavi day least 8 everi day wake time everi day possibl 2 protein protein intak extrem low recoveri definit hinder evid post workout protein increas recoveri protein intak follow 48 hour signific factor well peopl suggest massag ice bath epsom salt other studi suggest may reduc sore none proven aid recoveri

1856,"Don't be perfect, be consistent...","Consistency is the key to improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

If you work a 9-5, or something similar, the chances are high that all your boss wants out of you is consistency; anything given AFTER that is just a plus.

In anything and everything I do, my primary focus is always on, “How can I be more consistent?""

\- How can I put in consistent lap-times in my racing simulator, instead of the one, ultra-fast lap that I’ll never do again?

\- How can I consistently go viral?

\- How can I consistently execute my build-orders in StarCraft 2?

\- How do I keep a consistent workout schedule?

When it comes to dance, that last one is important, but even MORE important than that is this: how do you keep a consistent dance *style?*

Of course, you want your style to always be evolving, you want to be learning a new move at least once a day or once every *other* day, increasing your dance vocabulary, but how do you keep a style that’s all your own? Most people automatically think it’s this complicated process, but it’s actually quite simple, once you have a process to follow; after that, you’ve just got to put in the time and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what’s the key to consistently having a style that’s all your own?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, if you look at guys like [Anthony Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZsz3SLX03A&amp;t=35s), [Ben Cheung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD_kEoLpy5w), and [Joe Larot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo9jxFJNqXM) just to name a couple (always look to the best and analyze what they’re doing right), when they freestyle, you don’t know what specific moves they’re going to do, but we can all agree that there’s a general sense of movement that is uniquely THEIRS; in fact, this was what was so *fun* about watching the Jabbawockeez: even though you couldn’t see their faces and they all looked the same, [the moment one started soloing, you could figure out exactly who was dancing!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJPaLTaRVNE)

&amp;#x200B;

That’s your goal: to be identifiable SOLELY by your own, unique style.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s not about the individual moves, but the overall moveMENT; the *way* in which you combine the individual moves you’ve learned is something that can be uniquely YOURS!

So, during your hourly sessions, focus on creating small sequences of moves that you can easily drill, actually *drill* them without music first, then play some music and see where in the song you can start fitting these sequences. REMEMBER: it’s okay to slightly mess-up at first, have fun with this, and don’t get caught-up or discouraged by *any* small mistakes; if this process were easy, everyone would do it!

This mentality-shift can be also be useful for your hobbies and side hustles, as well as in the regular workplace! You know, if you have a job, a 9-5, 8-5, 7-5, whatever it may be, I’m willing to bet that your boss, no matter what your job is, all he or she wants to see out of you is consistency, because once you’re a consistent employee, you’ve also become a RELIABLE employee, remember that.

When we jog, we dont go anywhere. I envision jogging being more productive. We jog a mile or two up and then a mile or two back. We dont go anywhere or do anything when we jog.

All the places you can walk to, you walk there instead of driving your car and then you start to jog to those places until you can jog all the way to them and all the way back.

1859,Alternative Cardio Suggestions,"Hey everyone, first time on this sub and I'm hoping to find some advice. Recently had some medical issues regarding frequent light-headedness and limb numbness/unresponsiveness. Normally healthy and exercised occasionally, but the last 2 years it just kept getting worse and worse. Finally went in to see someone when I obtained health insurance again and have been tentatively (still more tests to do) diagnosed with moderate Orthostatic Hypotension. Essentially, my blood pressure has naturally become super low over time, and most activities that get my heart rate up cause severe dizziness and basically my extremities feel like they are 'asleep'.

I've been trying to find ways to remain somewhat fit, I'm 6'0 190lbs, but outside of some free weights and riding my bike every now and again, I can't do any kind of cardio. I joked at first because I hate cardio anyway, but a stronger heart helps increase blood pressure. 

Looking for some safe tips to do that. Running/jogging can't be done anymore. I've tried and I fall over because of dizziness and my legs stop working and I don't want to get caught in a situation I can't get myself home from. Biking isn't as bad, but it's hard to do on a regular workout routine where I live and I have the same other concerns as above. Open to any ideas, I don't know why I can't think of any that doesn't involve a semi-heavy investment into equipment of any kind.

1871,"Good habits are the foundation to good exercise habits, and a good life.","This morning I brushed my teeth and realized just how important good habits are in life.

I learned how to brush my teeth in the 2nd grade, they literally taught me IN CLASS how to do it!

The result? I haven’t had a cavity in 15 years and counting! Do you think that’s a coincidence? I sure don’t.

&amp;#x200B;

Good, small habits are the foundation to larger, and even more useful, habits.

Case in point: I used to NOT go to the gym on a regular basis to practice freestyle dancing; when I should've been going every single day, I would instead go every 3-4 days or so.

&amp;#x200B;

The result?

&amp;#x200B;

I stagnated. I'd be doing the same moves as I was doing a month ago, with no improvement; in fact, the OPPOSITE was happening! I was getting worse.

I began to have so much self-doubt, pondering whether I should pursue dance at all...

But today, that all changes. Dance is my passion, and I realize now that passions don't turn into good habits all on their own; they must be CONSCIOUSLY MADE into habits. No one's schedule is too busy to set aside 1 hour a day to exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

1893,Smaller waist/stomach but want to grow thighs and butt,"So I’ve been wanting to get my physique in shape, and I’m looking to lose the fat i have in my stomach and sides and build muscle there, however, I want to get my thighs and butt THICKER. How do i do this? I know doing cardio will help burn the fat on my stomach but i dont want to lose the fat in my thighs and make them skinny and toned? So how do i gain weight there but lose my stomach?

 Edit; i know the answer may seem straightforward or obvious, but when doing research and what not, i got kind of confused bc a few ppl ive watched on youtube who gave tips on how they maintained a slim waist but grew their glutes/thighs talked abt they had to do a caloric surplus but didnt really clarify how they kept the fat down in their stomach. One person I watched who had the ideal body i’m going for didnt give details on her workout/diet which i was hoping she would do so i could follow along (though i think its bc she did a program through “bodiesbyrachel” on ig which you have to pay for. they design workouts and meal plans specifically for you and your desired goals so im guessing she wasnt allowed to share personal details)

Also, to think abt the body im trying to achieve, think rihanna. NOT her exact body but how she gained weight. She was in the skinny/medium body range early in her career and then gained alot of weight out of nowhere circa 2017ish maybe? But it was gained in a way where her stomach remained flat and small w/ no side fat but she still had thick toned thighs, calves and butt. Basically slim thick if you will.
